G.R. No. 235725,"JOEL A. TAPIA, PETITIONER, VS. GA2 PHARMACEUTICAL, INC., RESPONDENT.",9/28/22,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/68858,SECOND DIVISION,LAZARO-JAVIER,"therefore, petitioner Reyes was not amiss in thinking that his employment has indeed already been terminated. (Emphases supplied, citations omitted)[61] Being his immediate superior and GA2's general manager, Tapia believed that Saldanha had terminated his employment right upon the latter's command that he (Tapia) should go home and should no longer come back. Consequently, Tapia immediately filed the illegal dismissal case below. Tapia's factual version of the incident inspires belief and his immediate remedial action confirms its credence.[62] That no one among his co-employees came forward to support his complaint is quite understandable. It is understandable, too, that Tapia's co-employees executed the Affidavit dated December 9, 2015 (Affidavit)[63] which contravened Tapia's account and supported the claims of GA2, their employer. Tapia's co-employees were naturally beholden to GA2 because their employment depended on the company. They would have done anything asked of them just so they could keep their employment.[64] They certainly would have incurred the ire of GA2 had they disagreed with its version of events. Thus, the Affidavit is, at best, self-serving.[65] More important, the Affidavit did not even categorically refute Tapia's main cause of action‚Äö√Ñ√Æthe fact of his summary dismissal on June 11, 2015.[66] On the issue of abandonment, we quote with concurrence the disquisition of the Court of Appeals, viz.: [We] do not, however, find its allegation of abandonment of work tenable. It has been invariably held that the filing of complaint negates any suggestion of abandonment. The alleged notice to explain, as correctly held by the NLRC, cannot be taken as evidence of abandonment as there is no indication that it was actually received by Tapia. As to the affidavit submitted, we agree with the NLRC that it is at best self-serving having been executed by employees beholden to their employer. x x x[67] We now reckon with the length of time Tapia was employed with GA2. Notably, he has invariably claimed that his employment began in July 2013. His payroll slips on record bear the dates July 2013 and August 2013, and GA2's FDA license to operate bears his name as the resident pharmacist of GA2's Mandaluyong branch as of August 2013. GA2 countered by presenting a probationary contract which Tapia allegedly signed to show that his employment started only in March 2015.[68] It also submitted the affidavit of Bolsico, GA2's franchise holder and the alleged employer of Tapia in July 2013.[69] We agree with Tapia. The Court has consistently ruled that there is no hard and fast rule designed to establish the elements of an employer-employee relationship. Some forms of evidence that have been accepted to establish the elements include, but are not limited to, identification cards, cash vouchers, social security registration, appointment letters or employment contracts, payroll, organization charts, and personnel lists, among others.[70] Here, Tapia's documentary evidence, i.e., July and August 2013 payroll slips and the FDA license showing he was the resident pharmacist at GA2's Mandaluyong branch in August 2013, corroborated by his testimonial evidence, sufficiently establish his claim that his employment began in July 2013. The probationary employment contract, though in writing, does not prevail over Tapia's evidence. The NLRC, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, discarded the probationary contract being a mere afterthought. GA2 belatedly presented the contract despite Tapia's earlier assertion that he was hired in July 2013. Indeed, he was never a probationary employee. Too, the fact that Bolsico submitted an affidavit that Tapia was her part-time pharmacist does not contradict Tapia's claim that his employment with GA2 began in July 2013. Again, GA2 submitted its evidence too late in the day and only when it filed its motion for reconsideration of the NLRC's ruling. All told, the NLRC correctly ruled that Tapia was illegally dismissed and that he is entitled to backwages, separation pay (in lieu of reinstatement), and attorney's fees.[71] We clarify however that the attorney's fees shall be received by the PAO as a trust fund to be used for the special allowances of its officials and lawyers, in accordance with Chapter 5, Title III, Book IV of Executive Order No. 292, or the Administrative Code of 1987, as amended by Republic Act No. 9406.[72] FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated July 12, 2017 and Resolution dated October 27, 2017 in CA-G.R. SP No. 148274 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the Decision dated June 30, 2016 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC LAC No. 04-001073-16 is REINSTATED.

As an accountable officer, the exercise of proper diligence would have compelled her to place government funds in her custody in a more secured . location such as a safety vault, rather than inside her wooden cabinet, which locks could easily be destroyed. Clearly, the loss of the PEI bonuses of the municipal employees through robbery will not totally exculpate her from liability. Other than her bare allegations, the records bare no evidence showing that she caused the repair of the defective vault or requested for a serviceable one, which locks could have provided more security for her money accountabilities; Lamentably, such failure to use that reasonable care and caution which an ordinarily prudent person would have used in the same situation' demonstrates petitioner's: contributory negligence.[91] Petitioner Rosita's inability or failure, though committed evidently through inadvertence, lack of attention, or carelessness, amounts to simple neglect of duty.Simple neglect of duty is defined as the failure of an employee to give proper attention to a required task or to discharge a duty due to carelessness or indifference. On the other hand, gross neglect of duty is characterized by want of even the slightest care, or by conscious indifference to the consequences, or by flagrant and palpable breach of duty.[92]Under Section 46(D)(l), Rule 10 of CSC Resolution No. 1101502 dated 8 November 2011, otherwise known as the ""Revised Rules on Cases in the Civil Service'', simple neglect of duty is a less grave offense, punishable by suspension of one (1) month and one (l) day to six (6) months for the first offense. Section 48(1) of the same rule clarifies that ""first offense"" may be considered as a mitigating:circumstance. Moreover, Section 49(a) provides that ""[t]he minimum of the.penalty shall be imposed where only mitigating and no aggravating circumstances are present.""In light of the foregoing legal and jurisprudential precepts, the Court echoes with approbation the imposition by the Court of Appeals of the penalty of suspension from service for one month and one day without pay upon petitioner Rosita, this being her first offense.The Commission on Audit Commission Proper did not gravely abuse its discretion in affirming the denial of petitioner Rosita's request for relief from money accountability.At this point, it bears to highlight that the Court's power to review decisions of the Commission on Audit via Rule 64 petitions is limited to jurisdictional errors or grave abuse of discretion the Court generally upholds the Commission on Audit's ruling, especially in the absence of grave abuse on its part.[93]A cursory. perusal of the certiorari petition in G.R. No. 256013 divulges that petitioner Rosita failed to allege any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the.Commission on Audit in rendering-the assailed Decision and Resolution. Instead, she asserts her innocence and posits that she was not negligent in safekeeping. the public funds in her custody. She avouches that the Commission on Audit gravely erred in denying her request for relief from accountability.Quite discernibly, arguments raised by petitioner Rosita are not averments of grave abuse of discretion. At best, the errors imputed upon the Commission on Audit are mere errors of judgment that cannot be remedied via certiorari. [94] She bears the burden of proving 'not merely reversible error' committed by the Commission on Audit, but such a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.[95] Even if so alleged, her recourse is still deficient in intrinsic merit. The Commission on Audit committed no grave abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Decision and Resolution since its findings of negligence on the part of petitioner Rosita are to be respected for being supported by substantial evidence.In arriving at its conclusion, the Commission on Audit relied on the Reinvestigative Report[96] of the Audit Team, which established that petitioner Rosita placed the money inside her center drawer because the old vault in her room could no longer be opened Given petitioner Rosita's insouciance in not employing measures to secure a new vault or much less, to cause the repair of the defective vault in her office, the Commission on Audit concluded that she failed to exercise the diligence. required of her position as custodian of government funds. As this Court previously enunciated ""a person who is negligent in keeping the funds cannot be relieved from liability.""[97] Verily, petitioner has to answer for the loss of the funds in. her custody, consistent with the provisions of Section 105 of P.D. No. 1445.[98]THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, the consolidated Petitions are hereby DENIED and the following are AFFIRMED:(1) Resolutions dated 21 March 2017 and 18 July 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-9.R.

FERRARIS, JR., BRANCH 7, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT IN CITIES, DAVAO CITY AND VIVIAN N. ODRU‚àö√´A, CLERK OF COURT III, SAME COURT, RESPONDENTS.",12/6/22,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/68695,EN BANC,"LOPEZ, M., J.:","therefore, be considered by the Court.[20]RULINGThe Court agrees with the OCA's findings but modifies the recommended penalties, following the amendments in Rule 140 after Rules of Court (Rule 140).Rule 140 of the Rules of Court governs administrative disciplinary cases against judges. Several amendments were later introduced. In A.M. No. 18-01-05-SC[21], the Court amended Rule 140 to include the entire Judiciary personnel. In A.M. No. 21-03-17-SC[22], Court increased the imposable fines taking into account the depreciation of the value of the Philippine Peso. In A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC[23], the Court further amended Rule 140 by classifying certain offenses as serious, less serious, and light charges, increasing the period of suspension, and categorically providing for the retroactive application of the amendments. A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC sought to introduce an updated disciplinary framework for the entire Judiciary and harmonize existing jurisprudence on classifying offenses and imposing penalties.[24]Before its amendment, Section 9,[25] Rule 140 of the Rules of Court[26], classifies undue delay in rendering a decision or order and violating the relevant circulars as less serious charges. Section 11[27], on the other hand, prescribes the penalty of suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) month but not more than three (3) months or a tine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00.In A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, the offense of ""undue delay in rendering a decision or order"" was removed. Instead, it can be considered either as gross or simple neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance of official functions classified as serious and less serious charges[28], respectively:Section 14. Serious Charges. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Serious charges include:x x x x(d) Gross neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance of official functions;Section 15. Less Serious Charge s. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Less serious charges include:x x x x(b) Simple neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance of official functions;The new rule also categorically provides that multiple penalties must be imposed for multiple offenses:Section 21. Penalty for Multiple Offenses. ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ If the respondent is found liable for more than one (1) offense arising from separate acts or omissions in a single administrative proceeding the Court shall impose separate penalties for each offense. x x xIn Boston Finance and Investment Corporation v. Gonzales,[29] the Court explained that ""the multiplicity of penalties to be imposed on judges and justices is consistent with the higher level of decorum expected from them.""[30]Judge Ferraris, Jr.'s liabilityApplying the new rules, Judge Ferraris, Jr. is guilty of two (2) counts of gross neglect of duty in the performance of official functions, one (1) count of simple neglect of duty, and one (1) count of violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars that establish an internal policy, rule of procedure or protocol. As observed by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa, it is imperative to examine Judge Ferraris, Jr.'s acts and omissions and determine whether he should be held guilty for multiple offenses following the higher level of decorum expected from the judges.Gross neglect is such neglect which, from the gravity of the case or frequency of instances, becomes so serious in its character as to endanger or threaten the public welfare.[31] It also refers to negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care that even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to give to their own property.""[32] Simple neglect of duty means the ""failure of an employee or official to give proper attention to a task expected of him or her, signifying a 'disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference.""[33]Consistent with the rule on multiple offenses, the Court would examine Judge Ferraris, Jr.'s acts and omissions based on the court processes involved and the corresponding delay, namely: (1) resolution of a case; (2) resolution of pending incidents or motions; and (3) other matters that need court action.Notably, the litigants deserve their constitutional right to a speedy trial and a speedy disposition of their cases.[34] The corollary to this right is the duty mandated by Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct for judges to ""dispose of the court's business promptly and decide cases within the required periods."" Rule 3.07 and Rule 3.08 require a judge to ""maintain professional competence in court management"" and ""supervise the court personnel to ensure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business."" The New Code of Judicial Conduct reiterates the judges' obligations to ""perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly and with reasonable promptness.""[35]Delay undermines the people's faith in the judiciary from whom the prompt hearing of their supplications is anticipated and expected. It also reinforces the litigants' impression that the wheels of justice grind ever so slowly.[36] Thus, a judge is administratively liable if he commits unreasonable delay in the disposition of cases.[37]In incurring delay in resolving a civil case covered by the Rules on Su1mnary Procedure, Judge Ferraris, Jr. committed simple neglect of duty. It took him an additional ten (10) days to decide the case, but he did not explain the delay.[38] This unexplained delay demonstrates indifference to observing the prescribed period to resolve cases.In incurring delay in resolving motions and failure to take appropriate actions on pending incidents, Judge Ferraris, Jr. committed gross neglect of duty. The length of delay and frequency qualify the neglect of duty as gross. In six (6) criminal cases[39], Judge Ferraris, Jr. took eight (8) months to require the DENR-CENRO to file its comment on the motion to plea bargain. He also failed to take timely action in four (4) civil cases[40] pending for years. While Judge Ferraris, Jr. claimed that he took proper actions on the pending incidents, no proof was submitted to substantiate the court's action.[41] In three (3) civil cases,[42] Judge Ferraris, Jr. did not submit proof that he resolved a pending motion in Civil Case No. 13,778-G-2003 and claimed that he did not act on two motions (Civil Case No. 21,451-G-09 and Civil Case No. 10,673-G-2001) for being erroneous. The Court cannot accept the explanation without proof. Also, Judge Ferraris, Jr. should still resolve or act on the motions even if he deemed them as erroneous.In failing to act in over four hundred (400) criminal cases after directing the submission of counter-affidavits, Judge Ferraris, Jr. is again guilty of gross neglect of duty. These cases' sheer number and nature are sufficient to consider the neglect serious. The revised rules on summary procedure cover the majority of these criminal cases. The delay is contrary to the purpose of adopting rules on summary procedure to achieve expeditious and inexpensive determination of cases[43]. Judge Ferraris, Jr. did not proffer an adequate explanation. The OCA observed:The team initially found four hundred fifty-three (453) criminal cases covered by the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure with no further action on the order to submit counter-affidavit x x x and seven (7) other criminal cases with no further setting/no further action x x x.The records do not bear the proof of mailing of the orders to submit counter-affidavit in one hundred fourteen (114) cases x x x giving the impression that the Orders were not released at all.Judge Ferraris and Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a belied the apparent failure to release the orders. They claim that the orders to submit counter-affidavit were actually mailed. They, however, failed to submit copies of the registry receipts/proof of mailing in each of the subject cases to support their explanation.Anchored on the allegation that the orders were actually released/mailed to the accused on the dates, which, to reiterate were not verifiable from the case records nor proofs thereof submitted to this Office as part of their compliance, they countered that the court cannot further act on a number of cases because the registry receipts and/or registry return cards have not yet been submitted by the Philippine Postal Office, and the six (6)-month period from the time each of the orders was released has not lapsed x x x.Even so, it is significant to note that there were hundreds of criminal cases covered by the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure with no further action after the court issued the order to submit counter-affidavit because it did not follow-up with the Philippine Postal Office the latter's failure to immediately hand over/send (1) the proof of mailing by registered mail, and/or (2) the return of service that would indicate the date when the accused received the mail matter, if duly served, or the return envelope/mail matter itself in case the same was unserved.Moreover, some orders issued more than a year ago proved to have been unacted upon as they were released only after the judicial audit was conducted. x x xWorse, x x x it is clear that Branch 7 delayed the release/mailing of the said orders for at least a month to a maximum of one (1) year and eleven (11) months in two hundred seventy-four (274) cases covered by the Rule on Summary Procedure x x x.x x x xIn addition, the court does not thoroughly check the actual status of the cases and the returns it received leading to the issuance of orders that do not correspond to the status of the case.x x x xIn sum, the court failed to immediately take appropriate action on hundreds of criminal cases. Moreover, it would likewise appear that the court did not thoroughly check the status of the pending cases and the returns it received. Consequently, the action taken thereon did not correspond to the status thereof. Thus, either the proceedings of the case is further delayed, or the case, which could have already been disposed of, remains pending.[44]Judge Ferraris, Jr. is also administratively liable for violating the OCA Circular No. 11-2018, which requires the preparation and submission of monthly reports of cases. Here, the monthly report of cases had incomplete entries. The column representing the cases submitted for decision is consistently left blank. The required list of incoming and outgoing cases per month was also not attached. He also did not comply with Administrative Circular No. 76-2007, which requires submitting a semestral docket inventory report. The report omitted some entries in the column referring to the ""last court action taken and date thereof"" and the cases disposed of. Judge Ferraris, Jr. also failed to initial the last page of each of the records examined and did not conduct the actual physical inventory of each case. The joint certification is also defective because it only mentions civil cases. Judge Ferraris, Jr. did not deny these audit findings.[45] He also failed to comply with A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC[46], when he did not include the trial dates for the prosecution and defense in the pre-trial order. He did not deny his noncompliance to these circulars and rules. Under Section 15 (e),[47] a ""violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars that establish an internal policy, rule or procedure, or protocol"" is considered a less serious charge.[48]Under Section 17 of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, the appropriate sanctions for serious and less serious charges are as follows:Section 17. Sanctions. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ(1)If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:(a) Dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Supreme Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;(b)Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six (6) months but not exceeding one (1) year; or(c)A fine of more than P100,000.00 but not exceeding P200,000.00(2)If the respondent is guilty of a less serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:(a)Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) month nor more than six (6) months; or(b)A fine of more than P35,000.00 but not exceeding P100,000.00.In imposing the penalty, Section 19 of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC provides that the Court may appreciate the mitigating circumstances of ""humanitarian considerations"" and ""other analogous circumstances."" Here, the Court considers Judge Ferraris, Jr.'s advanced age after reaching compulsory retirement and the adverse economic effects of the Corona Virus Pandemic[49] as mitigating circumstances and valid considerations in imposing the penalties. Section 20 of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC also provides that if there is a mitigating circumstance and no aggravating circumstance, the Court ""may impose the penalties of suspension or fine for a period or amount not less than half of the minimum prescribed"" under the rule.Considering that Judge Ferraris, Jr. has already retired, suspension from service can no longer be imposed. The minimum penalty of a fine of P100,001.00 for each count of serious charge (gross neglect of duty) and a fine of P35,001.00 for each count of less serious charges (simple neglect of duty and violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars that establish an internal policy, rule and procedure, or protocol) or a total of P270,004.00 may be imposed. Applying the mitigating circumstances, the Court deems it proper to impose the minimum imposable penalty or P135,002.00 or half of the prescribed penalty.Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a's liabilityClerks of court are essential and ranking officers of the judicial system who perform delicate administrative functions vital to the prompt and proper administration of justice.[50] Their office is the nucleus of activities, both adjudicative and administrative, performing, among others, the tasks of keeping records and seal, issuing processes, entering judgments and orders, and giving, upon request, certified copies of the records.[51] The clerks of court are required to be persons of competence, honesty, and probity because they are responsible for safeguarding and preserving respect to the integrity of the court and its proceedings,[52] maintaining loyalty to the court and the judge as superior officer, as well as the authenticity and correctness of court records, and upholding the confidence of the public in the administration of justice.[53] Gross negligence or gross neglect of duty refers to negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences, in so far as other persons may be affected.[54]The Court agrees with the OCA that Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a committed gross negligence when she failed to timely release two hundred seventy-four (274) orders in criminal cases covered by the revised rules on summary procedure, which directed the accused to file a counter-affidavit. Here, the lapse of one month to one year and eleven months before releasing the orders in two hundred seventy-four (274) criminal cases is unreasonable. These cases cannot proceed because jurisdiction over the accused's person was not acquired. The sheer number of criminal cases and the unreasonable delay demonstrate Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a's indifference to her duties and responsibilities as clerk of court. Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a's conduct shows her lack of respect for the litigants' right to speedy disposition of cases and contributes to the court dockets' unnecessary clogging and delay in the cases' disposition.Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a is likewise liable for simple neglect of duty. As the clerk of court, Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a exercises general supervision over all personnel in her court.[55] As aptly observed by the OCA, Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a failed to ensure that the court personnel under her supervision performed their duties relating to case records management. She also failed to ensure that the monthly and semestral docket reports contained accurate and complete entries. It must be stressed that the physical inventory of cases is instrumental to the expeditious dispensation of justice.[56] Although the responsibility rests with the presiding judge, it is shared with the court staff.[57]In her capacity as sheriff, Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a also demonstrated gross neglect of duty. Sec. 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court requires the sheriff to report to the court within thirty (30) days if the writ cannot be fully satisfied and state the reason. The sheriff is also duty-bound to make periodic reports every thirty (30) days until the judgment is satisfied in full, thus:SECTION 14. Return of writ of execution. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ The writ of execution shall be returnable to the court issuing it immediately after the judgment has been satisfied in part or in full. If the judgment cannot be satisfied in full within thirty (30) days after his receipt of the writ, the officer shall report to the court and state the reason therefor. Such writ shall continue in effect during the period within which the judgment may be enforced by motion. The officer shall make a report to the court every thirty (30) days on the proceedings taken thereon until the judgment is satisfied in full, or its effectivity expires. The returns or periodic reports shall set forth the whole of the proceedings taken, and sha11 be filed with the court and copies thereof promptly furnished the parties. (11 a) (Emphasis supplied)A sheriffs failure to implement a writ of execution has been characterized as gross neglect of duty.[58] The OCA found that sixty-three (63) writs were assigned to Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a front 2006 to 2017. However, the returns in the majority of these writs were only submitted in October 2020. Forty-one (41) of these writs remained unimplemented or unserved, and some of the writs did not state why these writs were not implemented.In explaining why the writs were not fully implemented, Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a claimed that in some cases, the defendant requested an extension of time to satisfy his obligation and that the plaintiff agreed to it.[59] Still, in some cases, the plaintiff requested to hold the writs' implementation to give time to the defendant to pay their obligations.[60] These excuses are unacceptable. In the absence of a restraining order, the officers charged with the enforcement or execution of judgments must act with considerable dispatch to not unduly delay the administration of justice.[61] Consequently, Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a cannot unilaterally exercise discretion to suspend the writ's implementation.The Court cannot accept Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a's justification of pure oversight in failing to submit the periodic reports. The periodic reports inform the courts of the proceedings undertaken to implement the writ and provide the court insights on the efficiency of court processes after the promulgation of judgment.[62] Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a's substantial delay in submitting the required periodic reports in the writs assigned to her and her failure to implement forty-¬¨‚â†one (41) writs constitutes gross neglect of duty. It shows her lack of diligence expected of her position as a former sheriff.Given the retroactive effect of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, Rule 140 is the applicable rule to Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a.[63] The separate infractions committed by Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a will not be treated as aggravating circumstances but separate offenses and will be met with separate penalties.[64] Gross neglect of duty in the performance or nonperformance of official functions is a serious charge, while simple neglect of duty is classified as a less serious charge.As discussed above, Sections 19 and 20 of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC provide that mitigating circumstances may be considered in imposing the penalties. Here, the Court considers the apologetic stance of Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a for her actions and inactions[65], the OCA's recommendation to consider Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a's fifteen 15 years of service[66], and the adverse economic effects of the Corona Virus Pandemic[67] as mitigating circumstances in imposing the penalties. Similar to the imposed penalties to Judge Ferraris, Jr., the Court imposes the minimum imposable penalty on Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a. A fine of P100,001.00 for each count of gross neglect of duty and P35,001.00 for simple neglect of duty may be imposed. Given the mitigating circumstances, a fine of P117,502.00 is imposed on Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a, corresponding to half of the minimum imposable penalties.The Court reiterates that the administration of justice is a sacred task and requires the persons involved to live to the strictest standard of honesty, integrity, and uprightness.[68] Unfortunately, Judge Ferraris, Jr. and Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a failed to meet these standards. Nonetheless, the Court, in Judge Argonosa-Maniego v. Salinas,[69] held that:The court has also ruled that where a penalty less punitive would suffice, whatever missteps may be committed by labor ought not to be visited with a consequence so severe. It is not only for the law's concern for the workingman; there is, in addition, his family to consider. Unemployment brings untold hardships and sorrows on those dependent on wage earners. (Citations omitted)In sum, the following penalties are imposed on Judge Ferraris, Jr. and Ms. Odru‚àö¬±a computed as follows:Jude Rufino S.

The violation of a party's right to due process raises a serious jurisdictional issue which cannot be glossed over or disregarded at will.""[75]Where, as in this case, a decision was rendered in violation of a party's fundamental right to due process, we have no choice but to consider the same void for lack of jurisdiction.[76]With the failure to comply with the requirements for a valid expropriation, we need not delve on the issue of whether respondent may take immediate possession of the property.Nonetheless, for clarity, this Court shall discuss the correlation between The Right-of-Way Act and the Local Government Code.The Right of Way Act governs the acquisition by the government of ""real property needed as right-of-way site or location for any national government infrastructure project through donation, negotiated sale, expropriation, or any other mode of acquisition as provided by law.""[77]Its Section 3 defines national government projects as:Section 3. National Government Projects. ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ As used in this Act, the term ""national government projects"" shall refer to all national government infrastructure projects and its public service facilities, engineering works and service contracts, including projects undertaken by government-owned and -controlled corporations, all projects covered by Republic Act No. 6957, as amended by Republic Act No. 7718, otherwise known as the ""Build-Operate-and-Transfer Law"", and other related and necessary activities, such as site acquisition, supply or installation of equipment and materials, implementation, construction, completion, operation, maintenance, improvement, repair and rehabilitation, regardless of the source of funding. Subject to the provisions of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the ""Local Government Code of 1991"", local government units (LGUs) may also adopt the provisions of this Act for use in the acquisition of right-of-way for local government infrastructure projects: (Emphasis supplied)Particularly on expropriation, the Act states that upon the filing of a complaint for expropriation, the implementing agency is duty bound to deposit with the court in favor of the property owner an amount equivalent to ""[100 percent] of the value of the land based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue . . . issued not more than three (3) years prior to the filing of the expropriation complaint[.]""[78]Meanwhile, the Local Government Code provides that before a local government unit may be permitted to take immediate possession of the property sought to be expropriated, it shall be required to deposit to the Regional Trial Court ""at least [15 percent] of the fair market value. . . based on the current tax declaration of the property to be expropriated[.]""[79]Harmonizing these provisions, The Right of Way Act applies only when the purpose of the expropriation is for the construction of a right-of¬¨‚â†-way site or national infrastructure project.However, when the purpose of the acquisition is not considered a national infrastructure project as defined by the said Act and a local government unit is involved, immediate possession of the property may be permitted upon deposit with court of at least 15 percent of the fair market value based on the current tax declaration of the property.FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is GRANTED.

A.C. No. 9338 (Formerly CBD Case No. 13-3815),"MELISSA ANGELA C. FERNANDO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ALEJANDRO JOSE C. PALLUGNA, RESPONDENT.",2/20/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/68897,SECOND DIVISION,"LOPEZ, J.","in view of Atty. Pallugna's previous suspension in Ramos v. Pallugna,[58] We deem it proper to impose a longer penalty of suspension against him.[59] However, We note that Atty. Pallugna had already been disbarred in 2021. In Philippine Island Kids International Foundation, Inc. (PIKFI) v. Pallugna,[60] this Court removed Atty. Pallugna's name from the Roll of Attorneys after it was proven that he violated Canon 10, Rule 10.01, Rule 10.03, Canon 12, Rule 12.07, Canon 15, Rule 15.07, Canon 19, and Rule 19.01 of the CPR.[61] With respect to the imposition of penalties against an already disbarred lawyer, We held in Valmonte v. Quesada, Jr.:[62] However, considering that the Court had already imposed upon respondent the ultimate penalty of disbarment for his gross misconduct and willful disobedience of the lawful orders of the court in an earlier complaint for disbarment filed against him in Zarcilla v. Quesada, Jr., the penalty of additional six months suspension from the practice of law can no longer be imposed upon him. The reason is obvious: ""[o]nce a lawyer is disbarred, there is no penalty that could be imposed regarding his privilege to practice law."" But while the Court can no longer impose the penalty upon the disbarred lawyer, it can still give the corresponding penalty only for the sole purpose of recording it in his personal file with the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC), which should be taken into consideration in the event that the disbarred lawyer subsequently files a petition to lift his disbarment. In addition, the Court may also impose a fine upon a disbarred lawyer found to have committed an offense prior to his/her disbarment as the Court does not lose its exclusive jurisdiction over other offenses committed by a disbarred lawyer while he/she was still a member of the Law Profession. In fact, by imposing a fine, the Court is able ""to assert its authority and competence to discipline all acts and actuations committed by the members of the Legal Profession."" All told, the Court finds respondent guilty of unauthorized practice of law. And although he has already been disbarred, the Court, nevertheless, deems it proper to give the corresponding penalty of six months suspension from the practice of law for the sole purpose of recording it in his personal file in the OBC. The Court, likewise, considers it necessary to impose upon respondent a penalty of fine in the amount of PhP 40,000.00.[63] Thus, aside from his suspension from the practice of law for two years, We deem it likewise proper to impose a fine of PHP 50,000.00 against Atty. Pallugna. FOR THESE REASONS, this Court finds Atty. Alejandro Jose Pallugna GUILTY of violation of the Lawyer's Oath and Canons 1 and 19 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and he is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of two years. However, considering that he has already been disbarred, this penalty can no longer be imposed but nevertheless should be considered in the event that he should apply for the lifting of his disbarment. He is also ORDERED TO PAY a FINE in the amount of PHP 50,000.00. Let a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be entered into the records of Atty. Alejandro Jose Pallugna. Copies shall likewise be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator, which shall circulate the same to all courts in the country for their information and guidance.

CASIMIRO* TAMPARONG, JR., RESPONDENT.",3/8/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69197,SECOND DIVISION,"LOPEZ, M., J.:","In view of [Tamparong's] acceptance of the monetary offer of [the Republic], let this case be referred to the Philippine Mediation Center (PMC), the soonest possible time. The PMC is hereby directed to issue the Notice to Appear directly to the parties.The mediator shall endeavor to complete the mediation proceedings within 30 days from the date of the initial mediation proceedings. The Mediator is hereby directed to submit to the [CA] a report on the result of the proceedings at the end of the mediation period. If mediation is successful, the Mediator shall forthwith submit to [the CA] the original Compromise Agreement entered into by the parties or alternatively, in the appropriate case, a satisfaction of claim or withdrawal of appeal. Such agreement shall be the basis for the rendition of a decision based on the parties' compromise agreement, which may be enforced by execution or may result in the dismissal of the appeal.[61] (Emphases supplied) Despite the court order, no compromise agreement was reached. The Republic offered no explanation for its refusal to settle in the amount it has consistently invoked, i.e., PHP 17,253,596.76. Meanwhile, the unfortunate denouement came about: Tamparong succumbed to death on December 3, 2018[62] and still remained unpaid his rightful compensation for more than 22 years now. [63] What more injustice can be caused to Tamparong as a landowner who, up to the time of his death, was not able to fully enjoy the benefits of the land taken from him by the government than to shortchange him with the delay in the payment of just compensation. Time, indeed, is costly to squander. Delays, justified or otherwise, have irreversible consequences.All given, the RTC, Br. 20, as affirmed by the CA, did not err or gravely abuse its discretion in fixing the interest to be included in the just compensation at the prevailing legal rate of 12% per annum from the taking of the property.[64] Applying the prevailing jurisprudential rules, however, we clarify that the 12% interest should be imposed upon the unpaid balance from the taking of the property, i.e., upon the issuance of the Order[65] immediately placing the Republic in possession of the property on November 29, 2000 until June 30, 2013 only. Thereafter, or from July 1, 2013 until full payment, the legal interest is reduced to 6% per annum.FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated May 30, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 06537-MIN, which affirmed the Order dated June 25, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 20 (RTC) in Civil Case No. 99-074 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum is imposed upon the unpaid balance of the just compensation as determined by the RTC in its Resolution dated January 21, 2010 from November 29, 2000 up to June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full satisfaction.The case is REMANDED to the RTC for the proper determination of the amount of remaining balance to be executed in accordance with this Decision.SO ORDERED.

LAPANDAY FOODS CORPORATION AND HIJO EMPLOYEES AGRARIAN REFORM BENEFICIARIES COOPERATIVE 1 [HEARBCO-1], RESPONDENTS.",3/13/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/68850,SECOND DIVISION,LEONEN,"Hence, jurisdiction properly lies with the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board.[72] The Regional Trial Court and Court of Appeals both ruled that the case did not involve an agrarian conflict and was instead a judicial matter.[73] Stanfilco upheld the findings of the lower courts and pointed out that no tenancy relationship subsisted between the parties.[74] It also pointed out that the validity of the agreement entered into was not in question. Instead, the resolution required ""the application of civil law provisions on breaches of contract, rather than agrarian reform principles.""[75] Here, there was no tenancy relationship subsisting between respondents, with private respondent Hijo Cooperative maintaining ownership of the land and only allowing private respondent Lapanday to manage part of the awarded land in the compromise agreement.[76] Private respondent Lapanday filed a complaint for specific performance with a request for a warrant of alias execution when private respondent Hijo Cooperative refused to abide by the terms of its judicially approved compromise agreement, which had been approved by a court.[77] Specific performance is ""[t]he remedy of requiring exact performance of a contract in the specific form in which it was made, or according to the precise terms agreed upon. [It is t]he actual accomplishment of a contract by a party bound to fulfill it.""[78] The remedy of specific performance requires the interpretation of civil law provisions on contracts. For an action of specific performance to succeed, it must be proven that one of the parties committed a breach of the contract.[79] It is not disputed that private respondents Hijo Cooperative and Lapanday freely entered into a compromise agreement which the Regional Trial Court judicially approved on September 30, 2011.[80] A judgment on a compromise agreement has the effect of res judicata and is immediately final and executory, as it is considered a judgment on the merits.[81] Nonetheless, the doctrine of immutability of compromise agreements admits a few exceptions to serve substantial justice.[82] However, the subsequent refusal of some of private respondent Hijo Cooperative's members to abide by the judicially approved compromise agreement is not a supervening event that would render its execution unjust and inequitable.[83] Clearly, the issues to be resolved in the present case for specific performance do not involve an agrarian dispute which would require petitioner's intervention. As in Stanfilco, the resolution of the case at bar requires ""the application of civil law provisions on breaches of contract, rather than agrarian reform principles.""[84] The lower courts thus did not err in denying petitioner's motion to intervene since there is no agrarian dispute to be resolved in the case at bar. They also did not err in upholding the final and executory compromise agreement between private respondents. As the Court of Appeals correctly observed: The case does not involve any issue on tenurial arrangement or compensation of agricultural lands or terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowners to farm workers. The only issue involved is whether or not HEARBCO-1 and the named individual defendants are liable for damages to Lapanday Food Corporation by reason of breach of contract. And as We have already held, reference would only have to be made on the relevant provisions of the New Civil Code relating to contracts, damages[,] and human relations. The case before the RTC was for specific performance of the [Banana Sales and Marketing Agreement] and [Banana Purchase Agreement] between Lapanday and HEARBCO-1. To reiterate, the parties later on decided to end the litigation by making reciprocal concessions in their compromise agreement. One of the concessions in the compromise agreement was for HEARBCO-1 to abide by its contractual obligations to exclusively sell all its banana produce to Lapanday and to give the latter the right to manage a certain portion of HEARBCO-1's banana plantation. When Lapanday sought the issuance of the writ of execution and the alias writ of execution, it merely sought compliance from HEARBCO-1 and all its members. It is the same subject matter of the case and the same subject matter of the judgment that became final and executory. The claim of the No Group/ MARBAI members is a separate matter that was taken cognizance of by the DAR Secretary, which is pending determination before the DAR.[85] FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED.

BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, RESPONDENT.",3/29/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/68978,THIRD DIVISION,DIMAAMPAO,"Hence, they instituted the present Petition,[47] ascribing error to the CA in upholding the challenged orders of the RTC. As an aside, the petition likewise seeks the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order to enjoin the RTC from continuing the proceedings in Civil Case No. 15-659 pending resolution of this matter.[48]IssuesThe primary issues tendered for this Court's resolution are whether the CA erred in: (1) upholding the Orders dated August 4, 2017 and February 1, 2018 of the RTC; and (2) concluding that the RTC acquired jurisdiction over petitioners.The Ruling of the CourtThe Petition is partly meritorious.At the outset, the Court clarifies that its review of the impugned Decision and Resolution of the CA is limited to determining and correcting any error of judgment committed in the exercise of its jurisdiction;[49] specifically, the Court will evaluate the case in the prism of whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC.[50]Considered in this light, the CA appears to have committed reversible error in arriving at its conclusion. The Orders dated August 4, 2017 and February 1, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court violated petitioners' right to due process. To recall, petitioners asserted in their petition for certiorari that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it served summons, and then subsequently issued its Order dated August 4, 2017, which denied petitioners' motion to dismiss, even before it acted upon petitioners' motion for reconsideration on the Order dated May 9, 2017. Petitioners decried these violations to their right to due process, especially since they were precisely asking the RTC to reconsider its resumption of jurisdiction over respondent's complaint, notwithstanding the latter's failure to heed the trial court's earlier directive to pay the necessary filing fees.[51]In addressing the same, the CA held that the unresolved motion for reconsideration was ""impliedly denied"" by the RTC through its August 4, 2017 Order, reasoning that in issuing the foregoing, the trial court had occasion to ""go over the record of the case and review the series of events that led to the issuance and service of the summons upon [petitioners].""[52] The appellate court cited the case of Orosa v. Court of Appeals,[53] (Orosa) where the Court held that ""a motion that is not acted upon in due time is deemed denied.""[54]The CA's reliance on Orosa was misplaced.A perusal of the Court's disquisition in Orosa would readily reveal that it was not on all fours with the factual circumstances of the present case, as what was under consideration there was a mere motion for additional time to file answer. Even in subsequent reiterations of this doctrine, the Court has never held that a trial court may ignore, much less dispense with, the resolution of a motion for reconsideration to its orders.In Sps. Salise v. Salcedo,[55] the doctrine was also applied with respect to a motion for extension of time to file compliance.Interestingly, in Eversley Childs Sanitarium v. Sps. Barbarona,[56] the Court reiterated this doctrine but with respect to a motion to withdraw filed by the Solicitor General of its motion for reconsideration of the CA's adverse decision. Without acting on the motion to withdraw, the CA ruled on the motion for reconsideration, which the Court held was an effective denial of the motion to withdraw.[57] Despite this finding, the Court nevertheless treated the CA's Resolution on the motion for reconsideration as without legal effect, given that it was issued in violation of the CA's own Internal Rules which provide that a subsequent motion for reconsideration would be deemed abandoned if the movant filed a petition for review or motion for extension of time to file a petition for review before this Court.[58] In arriving at this conclusion, the Court's foremost concern was to ensure that petitioner would not be deprived of its day in court because of mere technicalities, more so when the fault rested with the CA in not applying its own rules in treating the motion for reconsideration as abandoned.[59] Indeed, an earnest reading of the foregoing cases would show that the CA erred in applying the doctrine in Orosa. A motion for reconsideration is not in the nature of a motion for additional time to file a pleading.A motion for extension of time to file a pleading partakes the nature of an accommodation grounded on a sufficient reason and is always left to the sound discretion of the court.[60]On the other hand, a motion for reconsideration is filed ""to convince the court that its ruling is erroneous and improper, contrary to the law or the evidence,""[61] thus affording the court ample opportunity to rectify the same. By arbitrarily ignoring such a motion and continuing the proceedings, the trial court would be impairing the movant-party's right to be heard, which is a basic tenet of the fundamental right to due process. This finds special significance in this case since the Order that petitioners sought to reconsider was precisely on the RTC's resumption of jurisdiction over the case which it had already previously dismissed.Undoubtedly, the spirit of liberality behind the Court's pronouncement in Eversley Childs Sanitarium should find application to the case at hand in order to prevent petitioner from losing its day in court due to the RTC's own actions of disregarding its standing motion for reconsideration.Indeed, no less than the Constitution itself provides that ""[a]ll cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.""[62]This mandate directs judges to judicially dispose of the court's business, by resolving motions and incidents pending before them without delay, and by deciding cases within the required period.[63] This directive is also embodied in Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 1-88 which states that ""[a]ll Presiding Judges must endeavor to act to promptly on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before their courts.""[64]Well-settled is the rule that grave abuse of discretion arises when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence,[65] as in this case. By failing to timely act on the motion for reconsideration, the subsequent assailed Orders of the RTC were rendered in violation of petitioners' right to due process, contrary to the position of the CA. Consequently, these must be annulled and set aside.Nevertheless, the Court clarifies that the nullification of the Orders dated August 4, 2017 and February 1, 2018 of the RTC would not result in the dismissal of the case. These two orders dealt only with the resolution of petitioners' Motion to Dismiss dated July 5, 2017. Even disregarding the same, the status quo would be determined by the trial court's Order dated May 9, 2017, which affirmed its jurisdiction over the subject matter of respondent's complaint.Surely, by the trial court's own subsequent actions, it would not be difficult to guess how it would rule on petitioners' motion for reconsideration, and any further inquiry into the propriety of its determination would not only be beyond the scope of the Court's review but would be an exercise in futility. In the end, it is preferred that litigation be decided on the merits and not on technicality to afford both party-litigants the ample opportunity to ventilate their rights.[66] The Regional Trial Court has acquired jurisdiction over the petitioners. As to the second issue on whether the CA correctly upheld the RTC's determination that it had acquired jurisdiction over petitioners through the purportedly improper service of summons, the Court rules in the affirmative.As correctly observed by the CA, the process server's attempts to personally serve the summons to petitioners was wanting.[67] As the preferred mode of service, the return must indicate the steps taken by the sheriff to comply with the same, before substituted service may be availed of.[68] Failure to properly serve summons would mean that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.[69]However, the peculiar circumstances in this case warrant a relaxation of this rule. As the CA shrewdly noted, petitioners never denied that the summons was received by Mangaya per instruction of petitioner Eloisa Clarito Abayon herself to the building receptionist.[70] Certainly, there is nothing in the Motion to Dismiss dated July 5, 2017,[71] nor in its petition before the Court,[72] that would show that petitioners denied ever giving such an instruction. While this fact would not operate to do away with the express requirement under the Rules of Court on personal service, it should operate to estop petitioners from raising such an argument to divest the RTC of jurisdiction over their persons given that estoppel operates to render an admission conclusive upon the person making the same.[73]In any event, even assuming that the summons were invalid, the RTC would have still acquired jurisdiction over petitioners by their voluntary submission.""Generally, defendants voluntarily submit to the court's jurisdiction when they participate in the proceedings despite improper service of summons.""[74] Indeed, by filing pleadings where there are no unequivocal objections to the jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, the defendant may be said to have voluntarily submitted to the court's jurisdiction, which is equivalent to a valid service of summons.[75]Notably, while petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration to the Order dated April 15, 2016 was filed ad cautelam, its Motion for Reconsideration to the Order dated March 9, 2017, which sought to vacate the foregoing Order and to set respondent's motion for hearing, was filed without reservations and was, in fact, granted by the trial court. Its Opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration dated October 26, 2016, and its Motion for Reconsideration to the Order dated May 9, 2017, lacked similar reservations. It was only in its Motion to Dismiss dated July 5, 2017 that petitioners again made a reservation that the pleading was filed via special appearance.Evidently, even if the Court were to void the summons served, petitioners have already actively participated and sought affirmative relief from the RTC. Their numerous pleadings have shown that notice has been effected and that they have been adequately notified of the proceedings to allow them to sufficiently defend their interests.[76]Consequently, the RTC properly acquired jurisdiction over petitioners.With that, there is no further need to pass upon the other arguments raised. In the same vein, petitioner's concurrent application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order is necessarily denied.THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated April 29, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 13, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155382 are SET ASIDE in accordance with this Decision.

G.R. No. 262473,"MARILOU PALACIO Y	VALMORES, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.",4/12/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69664,SECOND DIVISION,"LOPEZ, M., J.:","Hence, the present recourse.[23] Marilou argues that the CA erred in affirming her conviction despite the prosecution's alleged failure to establish the elements of trafficking, i.e., that she recruited AAA and CCC for sexual exploitation and that she conspired with Sonny. In its Comment,[24] the People contend that the prosecution proved that Marilou was one of the perpetrators of the crime and that she hired women for sexual exploitation. The Petition is without merit. Under RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364, the elements of trafficking in persons are as follows: (1) The act of recruiting, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transporting, transferring, maintaining, harboring, or receiving of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders; (2) The means used include threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person; (3) The purpose of trafficking is which includes the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.[25] As found by the lower courts, the prosecution established the presence of the elements of the offense. First, AAA identified Sonny and Marilou, alias Analyn, as the persons who engaged her ""good service"" for foreigner customers who were holding a party at xxxxxxxxxxxxxx on February 2, 2016. While AAA believed that she only needed to show her body, drink, and party with the foreigners to get paid PHP 10,000.00 for one evening, she admitted that she had sexual intercourse with some of the men she met in the past. Second, Sonny and Marilou took advantage of AAA's vulnerability and need for money and persuaded her to meet with the foreigners at the hotel for sexual exploitation, thus:[26] Q: You said you received a text message from Ronron at that time, what was the text all about, Ms. Witness? A: ""Gusto mong magkapera nandito ang lalaki nagpapahanap."" x x x x Q: You said when you alighted from the jeep, you received another text message from Ronron, what was the text all about? A: ""Sige, hihintayin kita."" Sampung libo daw ang ibabayad sa amin. Down payment daw po Three Thousand. Q: What was the payment all about, Ms. Witness, that you were mentioning? A: For the customer, ma'am. Q: What will you do to the customer in exchange for that money? A: Good service, ma'am. Q: You said good service. What do you mean by good service, Ms. Witness? A: We have to give our best to the customer. Q: When you said that you are going to give your best to the customer, what do you mean by that? A: Yung katawan po namin ang iaano namin sa kanila. Laway lang po ang aming puhunan. Q: You mentioned, Ms. Witness, I will quote your answer, ""iaano mo yung katawan mo sa customer."" x x x x Q: What do you mean, ""iaano mo yung katawan mo sa customer at laway lang ang puhunan""? A: Parang ipapakita po namin yung katawan po namin tapos yung pagsasalita namin sa kanila gagamitin po namin para madagdagan po ang tip namin. x x x x Q: You said that when you reached xxxxxxxxxx, you met with Ronron and another guy. Who was this another guy? A: Sonny, ma'am. x x x x Q: After you went back to xxxxxxxxxx, what else happened, Ms. Witness? A: I saw several women and I saw also the wife of Sonny, ma'am. x x x x Q: After introducing the wife of Sonny to you, Ms. Witness, what else happened? A: We walked, proceeding to xxxxxxxxxx, ma'am. CCC similarly testified that a certain Alexis informed her that Sonny was recruiting girls or kumukuha ng babae. She proceeded to xxxxxxxxxx with the other girls recruited by Sonny. There, she met alias Marilou, who introduced herself as Sonny's companion/partner. Alias Analyn reminded the girls not to steal from the foreigners and made them board a van that would bring them to the hotel where the foreigners were.[27] Third, Sonny and Marilou recruited the women for prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation. PSI Saniano, who posed as foreigner Jeff, narrated how Marilou offered boys and girls to him for a fee through text messages. PSI Saniano and his foreigner decoy met with Marilou and Sonny at a restaurant so that they could examine the ""products,"" two teenage girls, being offered by Marilou and Sonny. The foreigner decoy agreed to avail of the ""products"" of Sonny and Marilou the following evening, thus:[28] Q: ... And what happened at that time, Mr. Witness, when you start[ed] to engage in text messages with the suspected trafficker Marilou Valmores [sic] alias Analyn? A: At first, ma'am, I introduced myself as a foreigner customer named ""Jeff."" I texted her and I told her that I got her number from her previous customers, ma'am. Q: And what was the reply you received from her? A: Actually, nagulat ako nun, ma'am, kasi yung mga previous cases namin na ganito, at first, we build up rapport sa tao para makuha muna namin yung tiwala. Pero yung sa kaniya, ma'am, yung text agad sa 'kin is, she immediately offered sixteen (16) to seventeen (17) year old boys and girls. Q: And how do [sic] you react when you received that text message? A: I asked them, ma'am, if they are [sic] experienced in having boys and girls? Q: And what was the response? A: And then she replied ""Yes,"" they are experienced. She tell [sic] sad story wherein according to her, the children (potential victims) were previously going to school but due to lack of money, they were not able to do so. And then, she also added that she also had thirteen (13) years old but the price is much higher than sixteen (16) to (17) years of age. x x x x Q: By the way, how did you recognize that it was the same Marilou that you were texting with is the suspected trafficker? A: She's wearing white blouse and when we saw her, my foreigner decoy just raised his hand, ma'am. Q: And what was her reaction when that foreigner decoy raised his hand? A: She went to our table, ma'am, together with a man and two (2) other young girls. Q: Okay. And what happened when they approached you at your table, Mr. Witness? A: I was introduced by the foreigner decoy as his trusted friend and driver in the Philippines as ""Ian""; so my name is ""Ian"" at that time, ma'am. And then at the same time, Marilou introduced her companions. Q: And who are [sic] the companions of Marilou that was [sic] introduced to you at that time? A: He [sic] introduced to us his [sic] companion: a man wearing a gray polo named ""Sonny"". And then the two (2) other young ladies as ""Shy"" and ""Jenelyn,"" ma'am. x x x x Q: And what transpired during that negotiation at Max's Restaurant? A: At first, ma'am, both of them were enticing me to get their product. They are [sic] saying that they (products) are nice, good[,]and young. Q: And what was your reaction when you said that they were enticing you? A: All I do is [sic] just to [sic] agree with them, ma'am. They also said that the ladies, ""Shy"" and ""Jenelyn"" are [sic] both seventeen (17) years old and they are [sic] ready at that time if we want to take them. Q: And what was [sic] your reaction when they are [sic] offering both the girls to you at that time? A: During that time, ma'am, I told them that according to my foreigner decoy, we have work early next morning so they just have to reserve the girls on February 2, the next day. On the morning of the entrapment operation, Marilou sent PSI Saniano messages saying she also had girls who can join orgies and threesomes but were not teenagers. She asked PSI Saniano for PHP 1,000.00 for the sanitation and hygiene expenses of the girls who were already in her house, thus:[29] Q: Mr. Witness, during the previous hearing, you testified that you met with certain Marilou and Sonny Febra together with two (2) girls at Max's Restaurant. After that meeting, Mr. Witness, what else happened? A: After that meeting, we parted ways, ma'am. The following day, February 2, I received again a message from Marilou that she has also girls who can perform orgy, threesome, who are dancers, but not as young as the‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ Q: When you received that message, Mr. Witness, what did you do? A: I did not reply to her message but she also texted me about her request for the initial amount of [PHP] 1,000.00 for the sanitation and hygiene expenses of the girls who are [sic] already on [sic] her house, ma'am. x x x x Q: What else happened after that Mr. Witness? A: Marilou told me that if I will send the money, just send to her partner in the name of Sonny Febra because, according to her, her ID was [sic] already expired. The testimonies of AAA, CCC, and PSI Saniano established that Sonny and Marilou conspired to commit trafficking in persons, in violation of RA 9208, as amended. Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit the same. The essence of conspiracy is the unity of action and purpose.[30] The concerted actions of Sonny and Marilou in recruiting the victims, offering them to the poseur customers for sexual exploitation, arranging for their transport to the hotel, and receiving payment for their services speak volumes of their common criminal design. Anent the penalty, Section 10 of RA 9208 provides that any person found guilty of committing any of the acts enumerated in Section 4 shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of 20 years and a fine of not less than PHP 1,000,000.00 but not more than PHP 2,000,000.00. The penalty imposed by the RTC, and affirmed by the CA, is within the imposable penalty. However, we deem it proper to fix the amount of fine imposed on Marilou at PHP 2,000,000.00, instead of the range imposed by the RTC. Moreover, the CA properly ordered the payment of moral and exemplary damages in the amount of PHP 500,000.00 and PHP 100,000.00, respectively, in favor of the private complainants and imposed interest of 6% per annum from the finality of the Decision until full payment, pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence.[31] In Brozoto v. People,[32] the Court awarded PHP 500,000.00 moral damages and PHP 100,000.00 exemplary damages to the victim of qualified trafficking because the offense is analogous to the crimes of seduction, abduction, rape, and other lascivious acts which cause the victim physical and mental suffering, besmirched reputation, moral shock, and social humiliation. FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated March 25, 2021 and Resolution dated August 1, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 44414 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Marilou Palacio y Valmores is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of trafficking in persons in violation of Section 4(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twenty (20) years and a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00. Petitioner Marilou Palacio y Valmores and co-accused Sonny C. Febra Sr. are jointly and severally ordered to pay each private complainant moral damages of PHP 500,000.00 and exemplary damages of PHP 100,000.00. All damages shall earn interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. SO ORDERED. Leonen, SAJ. (Chairperson), Lazaro-Javier, J.

G.R. Nos. 255324 & 255353,"COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. TOLEDO POWER COMPANY, RESPONDENT.",4/12/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/68972,THIRD DIVISION,DIMAAMPAO,"therefore, invoke these cases as legal bases to impress upon this Court the direct and entire attributability requirement of input taxes in claims for refund and issuance of tax credit certificate.This Court shall proceed to examine the provisions of Revenue Regulation No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88, which petitioner invokes.Pursuant to Section 245,[44] in relation to Section 4,[45] of the 1997 Tax Code, the Secretary of Finance promulgated on September 1, 1987 Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88. The revenue regulations implemented the provisions of the law imposing VAT on importation of goods and sale of goods and services. Section 16(a) of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87 reads:Sec. 16. Refunds or tax credits of input tax. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ(a) Zero-rated sales of goods and services. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Only a VAT¬¨‚â†-registered person may be granted a tax credit or refund of value-added taxes paid corresponding to the zero-rated sales of goods or services, to the extent that such taxes have not been applied against output taxes, upon showing of proof of compliance with the conditions stated in Section 8 of these Regulations. cdx x x xIn all cases, the amount of refund or tax credit that may be granted shall be limited to the amount of the value-added tax (VAT) paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.Where the applicant is engaged in zero-rated and other taxable and exempt sales of goods or services, and the VAT paid (inputs) on purchases of goods and services cannot be directly attributed to any of the aforementioned transactions, the following formula shall be used to determine the creditable or refundable input tax for zero-rated sale:Amount of Zero-rated Sale Total SaleTotal SalesXTotal Amount of Input Taxes=Amount Creditable/RefundableOn its face, it appears that the revenue regulations limited that amount of refund of input taxes to those paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction. However, this Court takes note of the guidelines in the determination of refundable or creditable input taxes as contained in Revenue Regulations No. 9-89.[46] Interestingly, petitioner failed to mention Revenue Regulations No. 9-89 which is similarly applicable to the instant Petition. The guidelines read:SECTION 3. Section 16 of RR No. 5-87, as amended by RR 3-88, is further amended by adding a new paragraph to be known as Section 16(c)(6); to read as follows:Section 16(C)(6). Determination of attributable input tax. ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ In general, the amount of refund or tax credit shall be limited to the amount of the value added tax (VAT) paid attributable to zero-rated transactions during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.Purely zero-rated transactions. Where the applicant is exclusively engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions, he shall be entitled to the entire amount of the value-added tax paid on purchases of goods and services, as well as on importations, notwithstanding the existence of an inventory of goods at the end of the quarter in which the zero-rated transactions were made, subject to the submission of a sworn statement attesting to the subsequent actual exportation or consumption of goods in the inventory and supported by appropriate export documents.For purposes of this paragraph, a VAT-registered person shall be considered as exclusively engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions if there are no taxable or exempt sales not only during the quarter covered by the claim but also that of the immediately preceding last three quarters prior to the claim. Incidental sales of obsolete or non-¬¨‚â†moving supplies, equipment, ""scraps"", and by-products of processed, manufactured or milled goods, etc., which are shown to have been subjected to value-added tax, shall not be considered for purposes of determining if the VAT registered person shall be considered as exclusively engaged in zero-rated of effectively zero-rated transactions.[47]Recognizing the confusion that might have stemmed from its previous pronouncements in Revenue Regulations No. 3-88, as amended, the Secretary of Finance promulgated guidelines in the determination of refundable/creditable input taxes attributable to zero-rated transactions. In effect, Revenue Regulations No. 9-89 explicitly stated that taxpayers engaged in purely zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions may apply for the refund or credit of the entire amount of input tax paid on the purchases of goods and services in the quarter in which the transactions were made.Thus, contrary to petitioner's notion, the applicable regulations at the time respondent filed its claim for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate do not require direct and entire attributability of input taxes.Tellingly, the CTA En Banc erred when it held that the provisions of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88 and Revenue Regulations No. 9-89, were inapplicable to the case at bench. However, despite the misapplication of law and regulations, this Court nevertheless agrees with the conclusion reached by the CTA En Banc.Still, the basic tenet remains: direct and entire attributability of the input taxes is not required in claims for tax refund and issuance of tax credit certificate. Thusly, the only requisites for a claim of refund or issuance of tax credit certificate of unutilized input taxes, as laid down in the Court's earlier ruling involving respondent in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Toledo Power Co. (To Pedo Power)[48] are as follows: 1)The taxpayer-claimant is VAT-registered;2)The claimant is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales;3)There are creditable input taxes due or paid attributable to the zero¬¨‚â†-rated or effectively zero-rated sales;4)The input taxes have not been applied against the output tax; and5)The application and the claim for a refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate have been filed within the prescribed period.[49]As to question of factPetitioner raises the question - Did respondent present sufficient evidence for the grant of tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate?In the determination of whether respondent is entitled to tax refund or tax credit certificate, the CTA examined the documents it had submitted on the parameters laid down in Toledo Power. As a specialized court dedicated to the consideration of tax problems, the CTA has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject. Consequently, its factual findings when supported by substantial evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal. Unless there has been an abuse of discretion on its part, the Court accords the highest respect to the factual findings of the CTA.[50] Its conclusions will not be overturned unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.[51]However, the rule admits of the following recognized exceptions applicable to tax cases: 1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; 2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3) where there is a grave abuse of discretion; 4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; 6) when the CTA, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both petitioner and respondent; 7) the findings of the CTA En Banc are contrary to those of the CTA Division; 8) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; 9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and 10) the finding of fact of the CTA is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and 1s contradicted by the evidence on record.[52]To be clear, the burden of showing convincing evidence that the appeal falls under one of the exceptions remains on the party filing the petition. A mere assertion is not sufficient.[53]In the case at bench, both the CTA Special First Division and CTA En Banc ruled that respondent is entitled to claim a refund or credit of its unutilized input value-added attributable to its zero-rated sales of electricity to National Power Corporation but only to the extent of P399,550.84.[54]The CTA Special First Division referred to the documents respondent submitted in determining the input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales. These documents were likewise examined by the court-commissioned independent certified public accountant. The court based its findings upon after a careful examination of all pieces of evidence presented by respondent, including supplier's invoices, official receipts, Bureau of Customs' Import Entries and Internal Revenue Declaration, and bank official receipts. It found that respondent was able to establish entitled to tax refund or credit in the amount of P399,550.84.[55] These findings were affirmed by the CTA En Banc.[56]In questioning the findings of the CTA, petitioner raises questions of fact. To determine whether respondent is entitled to its claim of refund or issuance of tax credit certificate for unutilized input VAT requires an evaluation of the documents and other evidence submitted during trial. Consequently, it becomes incumbent upon petitioner to prove that the listed exceptions are present in this case. Yet it failed to do so.Although the CTA En Banc failed to apply the provisions of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended, it nevertheless applied the correct principle of the law and regulations. In its appreciation of the evidence submitted before it, the CTA. Special First Division examined these documents vis-‚àö‚Ä†-vis the requirements under the foregoing disquisition and was convinced of sufficient proof for respondent's claim. Moreover, the CTA En Banc did not impose additional requirements not sanctioned by Section 112 of the Tax Code and Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended.In pr‚àö¬©cis, this Court finds no reason to disturb the factual findings and conclusions reached by the CTA.IN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated July 23, 2020 and the Resolution dated January 12, 2021 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in the consolidated cases docketed as CTA EB Nos. 1990 and 2000 are AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED.

However, other deviations from Section 21 are glaring in this case, which the prosecution failed to acknowledge, let alone justify. As the records show, the police officers took not a single photograph of the seized items. Interestingly, the arresting officers had even insisted that the marking and inventory be done at the police station because the pieces of equipment need d were available there.[87] Yet, they failed to do this one crucial step. Worse, the required witnesses for the inventory‚Äö√Ñ√Ærepresentatives from the media, the Department of Justice, and an elected official‚Äö√Ñ√Æwere absent. At most, the barangay chair, Factora, was supposedly present at the police station, yet the marking and inventory were apparently conducted without him.[88] That Factora was even present at the police station was unclear, as his signature in the inventory seems to be missing.[89] Even the lower courts failed to acknowledge these lapses, as they immediately focused on the movement of the drugs from their seizure to their presentation in court, without first discussing whether the noncompliance with the chain of custody rule was justifiable. Thus, the trial court had no basis to conclude that there was no ""gross, systematic, or deliberate disregard of the procedural safeguards[.]""[90] These unjustified lapses create a substantial gap in the chain of custody, raising doubts on the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs. Such doubt, on top of the drugs being inadmissible in evidence, warrants petitioner's acquittal. FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is GRANTED.

TAN, AS COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS OF THE PORT OF BATANGAS, AND SIMPLICIO DOMINGO, RESPONDENTS.",4/26/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/68966,SECOND DIVISION,LEONEN,"Hence, the present Petition.[34]Petitioner asks this Court to set aside the rulings of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc and declare respondents liable for indirect contempt. It asserts that the Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals was an express prohibition, enjoining the parties from discussing the matters of CTA Case No. 8004 with the media.[35]Petitioner adds that it presented adequate evidence to prove the individual participation of the respondents in the press conference and release of the press statement. Thus, respondents are in direct violation of the directive stated in the Resolution.[36]Petitioner also claims that the statements made by respondents were contemptuous, especially those that seemed to imply that Justice Acosta would be impartial due to his previous employment with petitioner. These statements were allegedly done in ""bad faith and solely for the purpose of influencing public sentiment instead of through proper legal proceedings.""[37]In their Comment,[38] respondents argue that the Resolution was merely an advisory. They rely on the use of the term ""advise,"" which is permissive in nature and does not contemplate an express prohibition to the parties.[39] They claim that the matters discussed in the press conference, specifically those in relation to Justice Acosta, were not within the ambit of the Resolution as these do not relate to the ""merits of the case.""[40] They add that the motion for inhibition they intend to file was only an ancillary remedy independent from the issues in CTA Case No. 8004.[41]In any case, they explain that the statements made were not contemptuous and petitioner failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt their participation and the presence of a malicious intent on their part. They add that the statements of Santiago should not be taken against them as he was not associated with the Bureau of Customs.[42]In its Reply,[43] petitioner insists that the Resolution provided a clear and explicit prohibition to the parties not to discuss the merits of the case with the media. It points out that had it been merely advisory, the Court of Tax Appeals First Division would not have warned the parties of contempt should they violate the directive.[44]Petitioner also claims it presented more than sufficient proof to show the active participation of respondents in the press conference. It adds that as the release of the press statement was simultaneous with the conduct of the press conference, respondents cannot say that they had no knowledge about it.[45]Finally, petitioner argues that the utterances by respondents were made in bad faith, ""with the intent of placing the [Court of Tax Appeals] First Division at a defensive[.]""[46]The issue before this Court is whether or not respondents Commissioner Napoleon Morales, Collector Juan Tan, and Collector Simplicio Domingo of the Bureau of Customs are liable for indirect contempt.The Petition has no merit.Though proceedings involved in indirect contempt are sui generis, this Court has previously resolved that indirect contempt should be akin to criminal proceedings.[47] Thus, the party claiming that the opposing party committed indirect contempt must prove beyond reasonable doubt the presence of a clear criminal intent to, among others, ""impede, obstruct[,] or degrade the administration of justice.""[48]Petitioner was unable to discharge this burden. It failed to convince this Court that respondents committed acts that constitute an attack on the dignity of the Court of Tax Appeals. Thus, respondents are not liable for indirect contempt.Petitioner invokes Rule 71, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, which respondents allegedly violated:Section 3. Indirect contempt to be punished after charge and hearing. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ After a charge in writing has been filed, and an opportunity given to the respondent to comment thereon within such period as may be fixed by the court and to be heard by himself or counsel, a person guilty or any of the following acts may be punished for indirect contempt;....(b) Disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order, or judgment of a court [;]....(d) Any improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice[.][49]Before determining whether respondents are guilty of indirect contempt, a discussion on the nature of indirect contempt proceedings is proper.Jurisprudence has explained in extent the concept of contempt:Contempt of court is defined as a disobedience to the Court by acting in opposition to its authority, justice[,] and dignity. It signifies not only a willful disregard or disobedience of the court's orders, but such conduct which tends to bring the authority of the court and the administration of law into disrepute or in some manner to impede the due administration of justice. Contempt of court is a defiance of the authority, justice or dignity of the court; such conduct as tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect or to interfere with or prejudice party litigants or their witnesses during litigation. The power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings and to the enforcement of judgments. orders, and mandates of the court, and consequently, to the due administration of justice.[50] (Emphasis supplied) The power to declare a party in contempt is extensive as it serves to protect the dignity of the courts and preserve the administration of justice.[51] Since this power is also discretionary, this Court has often reminded members of the judiciary to exercise care and restraint in punishing contempt and to use it ""judiciously and sparingly""[52] and when only the party demonstrates ""clear and contumacious refusal to obey""[53] the orders of the court. This power shall not be used as a retaliatory tactic and must be exercised on the ""preservative and not on the vindictive principle.""[54]To further guide judges and justices in their exercise of contempt powers, this Court has delved into the difference between criminal and civil contempt and their purposes. In Lorenzo Shipping Corporation v. Distribution Management of the Philippines:[55]Proceedings for contempt are sui generis, in nature criminal, but may be resorted to in civil as well as criminal actions, and independently of any action. They are or two classes, the criminal or punitive, and the civil or remedial. A criminal contempt consists in conduct that is directed against the authority and dignity of a court or of a judge acting judicially, as in unlawfully assailing or discrediting the authority and dignity of the court or judge, or in doing a duly forbidden act. A civil contempt consists in the failure to do something ordered to be done by a court or judge in a civil case for the benefit of the opposing party therein. It is at times difficult to determine whether the proceedings are civil or criminal. In general, the character of the contempt of whether it is criminal or civil is determined by the nature of the contempt involved, regardless of the cause in which the contempt arose, and by the relief sought or dominant purpose. The proceedings are to be regarded as criminal when the purpose is primarily punishment, and civil when the purpose is primarily compensatory or remedial. Where the dominant purpose is to enforce compliance with an order of a court for the benefit of a party in whose favor the order runs, the contempt is civil; where the dominant purpose is to vindicate the dignity and authority of the court, and to protect the interests of the general public, the contempt is criminal. Indeed, the criminal proceedings vindicate the dignity of the courts, but the civil proceedings protect, preserve, and enforce the rights of private parties and compel obedience to orders, judgments and decrees made to enforce such rights.[56] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted).Since the power to punish contempt must be exercised with care, it is important to first determine the type of contempt proceedings involved and the quantum of proof that the party urging the court to declare another party in contempt must overcome.Here, petitioner filed a case for indirect contempt against respondents for allegedly disobeying a lawful order and uttering statements that attack the Court or Tax Appeals. It argued that these acts are a form of disrespect toward the court. Following the characterization in Lorenzo Shipping Corporation, the contempt proceedings they sought for is criminal in nature.This Court has previously ruled that the principles and rules in criminal actions should apply similarly to proceedings involved in criminal contempt.[57] As such, there must be proof beyond reasonable doubt that a party has committed acts that intend to undermine the administration of justice and dignity of the courts.A party claiming that the opposing party disobeyed a lawful order of the court amounting to indirect contempt must first demonstrate the existence of an express order where the ""act which is forbidden . . . to be done is clearly and exactly defined, so that there can be no reasonable doubt or uncertainty as to what specific act or thing is forbidden or required.""[58]Petitioner argues that the Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals First Division was a clear and express prohibition addressed to the parties to avoid discussing the merits of the CTA Case No. 8004 with the media. It asserts that by participating in the conduct of the press conference and release of the press statement, respondents blatantly violated the directive and must be held liable for indirect contempt under Rule 71, Section 3(b) of the Rules of Court for disobedience of or resistance to a lawful order.We do not agree.Petitioner failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was disobedience on the part of the respondents.In particular, petitioner failed to identify the definitive act allegedly forbidden in the Resolution of Court of Tax Appeals First Division. To recall, the wording of the pertinent portion of the Resolution states:Likewise, during the pendency of the case, the parties and their respective counsels are advised to refrain from discussing the merits of the case in the media as it may be considered [contemptuous] by the Court.[59]We agree with the findings of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc that there was no clear act prohibited in the Resolution.In Grego v. Commission on Elections,[60] this Court has described that the use of the word ""may"" indicates that an order is generally permissive and directory in nature. Thus, the use of the words ""advise"" and ""may"" connotes that the Resolution was not an express command from the court that requires complete compliance from the parties.The words ""may"" and ""advise"" appear in the wording of the Resolution. Contrary to petitioner's belief, the Resolution was merely an advisory, not a directive nor a lawful order. Petitioner failed to provide proof that there was an absolute prohibition for the parties to discuss with the media. Absent an explicit order, it can hardly be said that there was disobedience on the part of the respondents that can be considered contemptuous.This Court reads the pertinent portion of the Resolution as a reiteration of the sub judice rule.The sub judice rule ""restricts comments and disclosures pertaining to judicial proceedings[.]""[61] It is designed to ensure that the court will not be influenced by discussion of the issues made outside of the proceedings. It also avoids any extraneous influence in the decision-making of the courts.[62]Sub judice is not explicitly mentioned in any Philippine statute or regulation. However, a violation of this rule is punishable under Rule 71, Section 3(d) of the Rules of Court, which declares in indirect contempt those who commit ""any improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice[.]""[63]This Court has acknowledged that the sub judice rule can be perceived as a restriction on the right to freedom of speech and information. To ensure that both independence of the judiciary and freedom of speech are preserved, this Court has since laid down the test to determine if a comment made in relation to a pending judicial proceeding already violates the sub judice rule:Two theoretical formulas had been devised in the determination of conflicting rights of similar import in an attempt to draw the proper constitutional boundary between freedom of expression and independence of the judiciary. These are the ""clear and present danger"" rule and the ""dangerous tendency"" rule. The first, as interpreted in a number of cases, means that the evil consequence of the comment or utterance must be ""extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high"" before the utterance can be punished. The danger to be guarded against is the ""substantive evil"" sought to be prevented. And this evil is primarily the ""disorderly and unfair administration of justice.""....Thus, speaking of the extent and scope of the application of this rule, the Supreme Court of the United States said ""Clear and present danger of substantive evils as a result of indiscriminate publications regarding judicial proceedings justifies an impairment of the constitutional right of freedom of speech and press only if the evils are extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high . . . A public utterance or publication is not to be denied the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press merely because it concerns a judicial proceeding still pending in the courts, upon the theory that in such a case it must necessarily tend to obstruct the orderly and fair administration of justice . . . The possibility of engendering disrespect for the judiciary as a result of the published criticism of a judge is not such a substantive evil as will justify impairment of the constitutional right of freedom of speech and press.""No less important is the ruling on the power of the court to punish for contempt in relation to the freedom or speech and press. We quote; ""Freedom of speech and press should not be impaired through the exercise of the power to punish for contempt of court unless there is no doubt that the utterances in question are a serious and imminent threat to the administration of justice. . . A judge may not hold in contempt one who ventures to publish anything that tends to make him unpopular or to belittle. The vehemence of the language used in newspaper publications concerning a judge's decision is not alone the measure of the power to punish for contempt. The fires which it kindles must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice.""[64] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted).The application of the clear and present danger rule in cases involving sub judice was discussed in Marantan v. Diokno:[65]The ""clear and present danger"" rule means that the evil consequence of the comment must be ""extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high"" before an utterance can be punished. There must exist a clear and present danger that the utterance will harm the administration of justice. Freedom of speech should not be impaired through the exercise of the power or contempt of court unless there is no doubt that the utterances in question make a serious and imminent threat to the administration of justice. It must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely threat.[66] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)The sub judice rule does not insulate the courts from fair and constructive criticism and comment from the public. The right of the public to express their sentiments on a case remains to be recognized.However, the rule protects against unwarranted and personal attacks that would already impair the public's confidence in the courts.[67] Thus, the threat that the comments would ""cause [an] unfair disposition of [the] pending case""[68] should also be readily apparent. Since proceedings involving indirect contempt are criminal in nature, there must also be a clear showing of malice and intent of the party to attack or malign the integrity of the court when they made their statements.[69]In determining whether a statement violates the sub judice rule, we look into whom such statement is addressed to.In Mercado v. Security Bank Corporation,[70] a letter addressed to a former chief justice of this Court was considered to be contemptuous. The letter was a plea by a losing party to the chief justice to reconsider the outcome of a case already resolved by this Court. It implied that the chief justice was pressured by the opposing party to decide in their favor.In ruling that the letter was contemptuous, this Court stated that the party acted with bad faith and malice. The party made several insulting insinuations that this Court was bribed. The statement made in the letter ""transgresses the permissible bounds of fair comment and criticisms bringing into disrepute, not only the authority and integrity of [the chief justice] and the ponente, but also of the entire judiciary.""[71]In re Macasaet,[72] this Court cited a journalist in contempt for authoring several articles regarding an alleged bribery incident in the Supreme Court. The articles described the members of this Court as ""thieves"" and ""basket of rotten apples.""[73] As a defense, the journalist invoked press freedom.In its ruling, this Court acknowledged the role of the press in strengthening the accountability of the courts to the public. However, it held that disrespectful comments in the guise of press freedom shall not go unpunished:Criticism at every level of government is certainly welcome. After all, it is an essential part of the checks and balances in our republican system or government. However, criticisms should not impede or obstruct an integral component of our republican institutions from discharging its constitutionally-mandated duties..... All told, illegitimate and uninformed criticisms against the courts and judges, those which cross the line and attempt to subvert the judicial process, must be avoided. They do a great disservice to the Constitution. They seriously mislead the public as to the proper functioning of the judiciary. While all citizens have a right to scrutinize and criticize the judiciary, they have an ethical and societal obligation not to cross that too important line.[74] (Emphasis supplied).In Cabansag v. Fernandez,[75] the party being accused of contempt wrote a letter to the Presidential Complaints and Action Commission regarding the delay in the disposition of their case before the trial court. This Court did not cite the party in contempt as their comments were addressed to the opposing party, and not to judge involved. There was also no ""serious imminent threat"" in the statements that would meet the clear and present danger rule.Similarly, in Marantan, this Court ruled that the statements did not violate the sub judice rule. In that case, the aggrieved party and their counsel expressed their lament, through a press conference, regarding the delay in the resolution of their case. This Court did not view the statements as posing an impediment in the administration of justice:As to the conduct of the Court, a review of the respondents' comments reveals that they were simply stating that it had not yet resolved their petition. There was no complaint, express or implied, that an inordinate amount of time had passed since the petition was filed without any action from the Court. There appears no attack or insult on the dignity of the Court either.""A public utterance or publication is not to be denied the constitutional protection or freedom of speech and press merely because it concerns a judicial proceeding still pending in the courts, upon the theory that in such a case, it must necessarily tend to obstruct the orderly and fair administration of justice[.]""Freedom of public comment should, in borderline instances, weigh heavily against a possible tendency to influence pending cases. The power to punish for contempt, being drastic and extraordinary in its nature, should not be resorted to unless necessary in the interest of justice. In the present case, such necessity is wanting.[76]Since the imposition of punishment of indirect contempt is considered as a remedy of ""last resort,""[77] this Court has been strict in its implementation. It will not use the same absent clear showing that the statements were made to ""impede, interfere with[,] and embarrass the administration of justice.""[78]Petitioner continues to argue that respondents expressed certain statements that not only violated the Resolution but were also made to influence the public sentiment regarding the issues being settled in CTA Case No. 8004. It insists that contrary to the findings of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc, respondents each had a distinct participation during the press conference and were even quoted by various publication with their statements. It asserts that respondents made such statements in bad faith and with the purpose of swaying the public sentiment.In particular, respondent Domingo was quoted stating that:Obligation to the Government is 7.3 Billion. What company or what surety company can held (sic) that asset or capital at least to pay that obligation just in case Shell lost? Nakikita n'yo ba yung point ko? No . . . no surety company has that asset 7.3 Billion. Sinasabi nila they want to go to government insurance system, GSIS. We told them how can you do that?[79] (Emphasis removed)Petitioner is mistaken. They were unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt that respondents made such statements with the intention to ""impede, interfere with[,] and embarrass the administration of justice.""[80]The application of the clear and present danger test requires the examination of whether the utterance will ""harm the administration of justice""[81] and if the statements made pose a threat where the consequences are ""extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high.""[82]This Court agrees with the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc that the utterances made by respondents on matters of CTA Case No. 8004 cannot be considered contemptuous.Petitioner failed to demonstrate how the statements will meet the requirements imposed by the clear and present danger test.These statements were made after the Court of Tax Appeals First Division already allowed the posting of the bond by petitioner in the collection case.[83] Regardless of any action from either party, the Division has already acted upon the issue on the posting of the bond. There was no more threat that the court would have been influenced in ruling on the posting of the bond.Still, petitioner insists that respondents made such statements with the purpose of swaying public opinion.We hold that this is speculative. There was no evident proof that there was genuine intent on the part of respondents to malign the Court of Tax Appeals. Rather, the statements made were criticism in relation to the actions of petitioner, not an attack on the Court of Tax Appeals.We adhere to our rulings in Cabansag and Marantan. It follows that the statements made in this case shall not be considered as amounting to indirect contempt.Petitioner also claims that respondents made an issue regarding Justice Acosta's former employment with petitioner during the press conference. Respondent Domingo was even quoted saying:The Judge being a former employee of the Shell and now hearing the case of Shell to be resolved by him would mean a conflict [of] interest, a clear case of conflict interest that['s] why we are filing this. The Supreme Court it says here, he is the fiscal services assistant. Assistant tax counsel Shell Group Companies of the Philippines, Ermita Manila, October 1975 to March 1981.[84]Respondent Morales was also quoted stating:""Judicial ethics mandate that a judge disclose his connections with a party to a case before him in order to place himself above reproach and suspicion,"" Morales said.Citing the Code of Judicial Conduct, the Customs chief said Acosta should disqualify himself from taking part in the case.Acosta may be 'unable to decide the matter impartially or may appear to a reasonable observer that [he] is unable' to do, Morales said.[85]The press statement circulated during the press conference was captioned ""Bureau of Customs Asks CTA Justice to Inhibit in Shell case"" and discussed Justice Acosta's previous connection to petitioner:Shell filed a case in the CTA to prevent the BOC from collecting the unpaid excise taxes. The BOC said that Acosta must inhibit himself from deciding the case because he never disclosed the fact that he worked as fiscal services assistant for Shell in 1975 to 1981.The BOC said that judicial ethics mandate that a judge disclose his connections with a party to a case before him in order to place himself above reproach and suspicion.The BOC, quoting the Code of Judicial Conduct, said that judges should disqualify themselves from participating in any proceedings in which they are unable to decide the matter impartially or in which it may appear to a reasonable observer that they are unable to decide the matter impartially.[86]This Court agrees with the ruling of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc that the statements were made only by respondents as an expression of ""what they believed as a violation of the basic principle of judicial ethics and to show their intention to file a Motion for Inhibition before this Court.""[87]The intention behind making such statements is crucial in determining whether there is indirect contempt.In Mercado, this Court required the showing of bad faith, which it defined as ""a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong.""[88] It added that the same ""contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill-will for ulterior purposes.""[89] It must be clearly proven by the claimant, petitioner in this case, and cannot be speculated upon.[90]To reiterate, there must be sufficient proof beyond reasonable doubt that there was an intention ""to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice""[91] for indirect contempt cases to prosper.Petitioner failed to prove the existence of bad faith or ill motive on the part of respondents. Using the clear and present danger test, there was no imminent threat posed by respondents' act of making such statements relating to Justice Acosta.This Court believes that respondents were only making fair comments in discussing Justice Acosta's failure to mention his prior connection to petitioner while being the presiding justice in CTA Case No. 8004.FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED.

G.R. No. 230299,"JANNECE C. PE‚àö√´ALOSA, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE A. OCAMPO, JR., RESPONDENT.",4/26/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/68864,SECOND DIVISION,LEONEN,"hence, an allegedly libelous Facebook post made before the enactment of the Cybercrime Prevention Act can be prosecuted under the libel provisions of the Revised Penal Code. But even then, the error respondent attributes to the withdrawal of the information is at best, an error of judgment or ""one in which the court may commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction.''[61] Such errors may only be remedied through appeal, a remedy which, as discussed in part II, cannot be brought by the private offended party like respondent. Furthermore, criminal laws are to be construed strictly against the State and liberally in favor of the accused. To further expound on this point, Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code and Section 4(c)(a) of the Cybercrime Prevention Act are reproduced side-by-side below: Article 355 of The Revised Penal Code Section 4(c)(a) of the Cybercrime Prevention Act ARTICLE 355. Libel by Means Writings or Similar Means. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ A libel committed by means of writing, printing, lithography, engraving, radio, phonograph, painting, theatrical exhibition, cinematographic exhibition, or any similar means, shall be punished by prisi‚àö‚â•n correccional in its minimum and medium periods or a fine ranging from 200 to 6,000 pesos, or both, in addition to the civil action which may be brought by the offended party. (Underscoring provided) SECTION 4. Cybercrime Offenses. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ The following acts constitute the offense of cybercrime punishable under this Act: . . . . . . . . (c) Content-related Offenses: . . . . (4) Libel. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ The unlawful or prohibited acts of libel as defined in Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, committed through a computer system or any other similar means which may be devised in the future. (Underscoring provided) Reading Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code, ""similar means"" could not have included ""online defamation"" under the statutory construction rule of noscitur a sociis. Under this rule, ""where a particular word or phrase is ambiguous in itself or is equally susceptible to various meanings, its correct construction may be made clear and specific by considering the company of words in which it is founded or with which it is associated.""[62] In Article 355, the associated words are ""writing,"" ""printing,"" ""lithography,"" ""engraving,"" ""radio,"" ""phonograph,"" ""painting,"" ""theatrical exhibition,"" and ""cinematographic exhibition,"" clearly excluding ""computer systems or other similar means which may be derived in the future"" specifically added in Article 4(c)(4) of the Cybercrime Prevention Act. If it were true that Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code already includes libel made through computer systems, then Congress had no need to legislate Article 4(c)(4) of the Cybercrime Prevention Act, for the latter legal provision will be superfluous. That Congress had to legislate Article 4(c)(4) means that libel done through computer systems, i.e., cyber libel, is an additional means of committing libel, punishable only under the Cybercrime Prevention Act. To make cyber libel punishable under Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code is to make a penal law effective retroactively but unfavorably to the accused. This is contrary to Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code, which states that ""[p]enal laws shall have a retroactive effect insofar as they favor the person guilty of a felony[.]"" For these reasons, an allegedly libelous Facebook post made may only be punished under the Cybercrime Prevention Act, not under Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code. Since the Facebook post complained of was made in 2011, a year before the Cybercrime Prevention Act was passed, there was no libel punishable under Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code. Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ there is no crime when there is no law punishing it.[63] The prosecution in this case correctly withdrew the information it had filed with the trial court. This Court's resolution of the Petition will not leave respondent without recourse. Under Articles 19 to 21 of the Civil Code, aggrieved parties may bring civil actions for damages ""for any harm inflicted upon them by defamatory falsehoods.""[64] More importantly, in civil actions, the complainant has full control of the case,[65] unlike in criminal actions such as the present one, where the complainant has to defer to the prosecution.[66] ""[The private complainant] must get the concurrence of the public prosecutor as well as the court whenever he or she wants the complaint to be dismissed.""[67] All told, there was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of Judge Capco-Umali in dismissing the criminal case for libel against petitioner. With the withdrawal of the information and the consequent dismissal of the criminal case he had filed, respondent cannot insist on the criminal prosecution of petitioner. He, however, still has the remedy of a civil action for damages should he opt to file one. FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' April 27, 2016 Decision and November 25, 2016 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 139928 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

In compliance therewith, the parties submitted their separate memoranda.[53] IssuesFrom the memoranda submitted, the primary issues tendered for this Court's resolution are whether the CA erred in holding that: (1) the proper remedy from a final order of dismissal in a criminal case is appeal and not certiorari; and (2) the trial court committed no grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the criminal case against respondents for lack of probable cause.[54]THE RULING OF THE COURTThe Petition is devoid of merit.As to the first issue raised, the CA did not err in holding that petitioner's case was dismissible outright for having availed of the wrong remedy.[55]""The dismissal of the criminal Information ..., was a final judgment because it finally disposed of the case. With the dismissal of the Information, the trial court's task was ended as far as deciding the controversy was concerned. There was nothing left to be done by the trial court.""[56]Undoubtedly, the trial court's Order dated June 23, 2014, which dismissed the Information against respondents, was a final order given that it conclusively terminated the criminal proceedings lodged before it. Resultantly, the said Order should have been impugned via an ordinary appeal before the CA in accordance with Sections 1[57] and 2(b)[58] of Rule 122 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and not a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, as was done by petitioner.Settled is the rule that ""where an appeal is available to the aggrieved party, the action for certiorari will not be entertained,""[59] as the ""[r]emedies of appeal, including petitions for review, and certiorari are mutually exclusive, not alternative, or successive.""[60]While this general rule admits of exceptions,[61] an assiduous review of the records of the case reveals that none are present here.Nevertheless, if only to promote substantial justice and to write finis to the controversy, the Court shall pass upon the merits of the case as the final arbiter to all judicial disputes.At this juncture, the Court clarifies that its review of the inveighed Decision and Resolution of the CA is limited to determining and correcting any error of law committed in the exercise of the appellate court's jurisdiction as is consistent with the nature of a Rule 45 petition;[62] specifically, the Court will evaluate the case in the prism of whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court,[63] as this was the mode of review elected by petitioner in instituting its petition for certiorari.Considered in this light, the Court of Appeals correctly held that there was no grave abuse of discretion in the Order of the Regional Trial Court, which dismissed the Information against respondents for lack of probable cause.Grave abuse of discretion implies ""such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.""[64] The abuse of discretion must be ""grave, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.""[65]Necessarily, not every error committed by the trial court in the exercise of its jurisdiction is correctible by a writ of certiorari and is limited to such acts so capricious and whimsical in nature as to amount to an absence of jurisdiction.Viewed under such lens, no grave abuse of discretion may be imputed in the trial court's challenged Order.To recall, the Information was already dismissed as early as the trial court's Order dated November 29, 2013 for petitioner's failure to establish probable cause to implicate respondents in the crime charged in the Information.[66] But when petitioner moved for reconsideration, the trial court afforded the State the opportunity to bolster its case and to submit additional pieces of evidence in the interest of justice.[67] Still, the evidence petitioner submitted could not concretely link respondents to the crime charged and this resulted in the dismissal of the Information in the trial court's Orders dated June 23, 2014 and January 21, 2015. Rather than ""disregarding"" the evidence petitioner submitted,[68] the trial court merely found the same insufficient after applying the provision of law involved in the crime charged. Certainly, such determination does not appear capricious nor whimsical as to warrant the issuance of a writ of certiorari.It bears stressing that the trial court's actions here are in accord with Section 6, Rule 112 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, which reads:Section 6. When warrant of arrest may issue. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ (a) By the Regional Trial Court. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Within ten (10) days from the filing of the complaint or information, the judge shall personally evaluate the resolution of the prosecutor and its supporting evidence. He may immediately dismiss the case if the evidence on record clearly fails to establish probable cause. If he finds probable cause, he shall issue a warrant of arrest, or a commitment order if the accused has already been arrested pursuant to a warrant issued by the judge who conducted the preliminary investigation or when the complaint or information was filed pursuant to section 7 of this Rule. In case of doubt on the existence of probable cause, the judge may order the prosecutor to present additional evidence within five (5) days from notice and the issue must be resolved by the court within thirty (30) days from the filing of the complaint of information. (Emphasis supplied)In the conduct of criminal proceedings, the trial court is well within its authority to order the prosecution to submit additional evidence. This is necessarily because the judge himself must be personally satisfied of the existence of probable cause before placing the accused under custody;[69] absent probable cause, the judge cannot be forced to issue a warrant of arrest.[70]The determination of probable cause ""is and will always entail a review of the facts of the case.""[71] Moreover, when the trial court's conclusion over a factual issue is affirmed by the CA, as in this case,[72] it is accorded the highest respect by this Court.[73]Indeed, the lower courts' determination of absence of probable cause centers on two points: (1) that there was no violation of Section 12.7 in relation to Section 73 of the Securities Regulations Code as an ""untruthful statement"" therein does not contemplate a forward looking statement, or a mere estimated completion date; and (2) that respondents' probable culpability has not been established through specific evidence linking them to the alleged violation.On the first point, there is a need for the Court to correct the lower courts' misconception.The violation complained of pertains to Section 12.7 in relation to Section 73 of the Securities Regulation Code, the full text of which reads:SECTION 12. Procedure for Registration of Securities. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ x x x xx x x x12.7. Upon effectivity of the registration statement, the issuer shall state under oath in every prospectus that all registration requirements have been met and that all information are true and correct as represented by the issuer or the one making the statement. Any untrue statement of fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading shall constitute fraud.SECTION 73. Penalties. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Any person who violates any of the provisions of this Code, or the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission under authority thereof, or any person who, in a registration statement filed under this Code, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, shall, upon conviction, suffer a fine of not less than Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) nor more than Five million pesos (P5,000,000.00) or imprisonment of not less than seven (7) years nor more than twenty-one (21) years, or both in the discretion of the court. If the offender is a corporation, partnership or association or other juridical entity, the penalty may in the discretion of the court be imposed upon such juridical entity and upon the officer or officers of the corporation, partnership, association or entity responsible for the violation, and if such officer is an alien, he shall in addition to the penalties prescribed, be deported without further proceedings after service of sentence. (Emphasis supplied)The contention here revolves around whether a contingent or projected date of completion may fall under the definition of ""making an untrue statement"" if the project or event does not come to pass on the said date.To this, the Court answers in the negative.To be sure, the Securities Regulation Code and its implementing rules do not define an untrue statement. Thus, the word should be interpreted in its ""natural, plain and ordinary acceptation and signification, unless it is evident that the legislature intended a technical or special legal meaning to those words,"" as ""[t]he intention of the lawmakers ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ who are, ordinarily, untrained philologists and lexicographers ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ to use statutory phraseology in such a manner is always presumed.""[74]An untruthful statement means one not in accord with facts or one made in deceit for ulterior motives.[75] Certainly, a statement may be factually untrue, with or without the knowledge of the maker, or one made intentionally false with ill-intent. However, the Securities Regulation Code goes a step further and assumes all untrue statements, whether intentional or unintentional, shall constitute fraud, as is evident in the express wording of Section 12.7, as above¬¨‚â†quoted. Given that the law does not distinguish, the courts should likewise not distinguish.[76] Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemus.[77]However, the very nature of contingent or forward looking statements means that, at the time they are made, their inherent truth or falsity is not evident even to the issuer itself. To recall, what the law punishes is making an untruthful statement at the time the registration statement is filed. This is necessarily impossible to do for projected events that rely on external factors for its completion that may be beyond the control of the issuer. Consequently, at the time the alleged violation occurred in April 1997, i.e., when the Registration Statement was first filed, there could have been no untruthful statements made on the part of Caliraya as to the completion date of its project. Nevertheless, this is not to say that Caliraya was not without fault. Its failure to amend its Registration Statement after the lapse of the original estimated completion date based on its own timeline, despite repeated notices from the SEC, would have rendered it liable for a separate clause under Section 12.7, i.e., ""[omitting] to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.""[78] Indeed, when it became clear that such estimate would not come to pass, it was incumbent on the registered issuer to amend its registration statement to correct the same in order to reasonably protect the investing public. This Caliraya failed to do.However, three barriers prevent criminal liability from being imputed to respondents themselves. First, the Information charges respondents for making an untruthful statement in the Registration Statement which, as above¬¨‚â†-discussed, is not the proper mode involved in this particular instance constituting a violation of Section 12.7 of the Securities Regulation Code. Second, the Information does not charge Caliraya, but only private respondents in their capacity as incorporators, members of the Board, and corporate officers. Third, nothing in the record directly links the respondents to the purported violation.Generally, corporate agents are not personally liable for violations of the corporation unless they willfully and knowingly vote for or assent to a patently unlawful act, or are guilty of gross negligence or bad faith.[79] In either case, their liability should not be presumed but must be proved.Even the Securities Regulation Code recognizes this limited culpability by only imposing a penalty on officers of the corporation ""responsible for the violation.""[80]Thus, unless it is shown how respondents were directly responsible for failing to correct the Registration Statement, no criminal liability may be imputed on them. Thus, the lower courts did not err in concluding that no probable cause existed to hold them personally liable for Caliraya's seeming violation of Section 12.7 in relation to Section 73 of the Securities Regulations Code.Probable cause refers to the existence of such facts and circumstances as would engender the belief, in a reasonable mind, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he was prosecuted.[81] To the Court's mind, the facts presented do not support a finding that respondents are probably guilty of the crime charged.Consequently, the trial court correctly dismissed the Information against them.THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated May 26, 2016 and the Resolution dated March 6, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA¬¨‚â†-G.R. SP No. 139734 are AFFIRMED in accordance with this Decision.SO ORDERED.

In sooth, to uphold COMELEC's stance would create an unfounded and inaccurate distinction between the manner of electing a member of the House of Representatives and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan by excluding the members of the Provincial Board from the application of Section 58 of RA No. 8797, as amended by RA No. 9230. This erroneous interpretation would effectively deny the lone legislative district of San Jose del Monte of its status as a full-fledged legislative district for purposes of entitling it to two seats in the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. Section 41(b) of RA No. 7160 does not distinguish between the manner of electing a member of the House of Representatives and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. Where the law does not distinguish, neither should this Court.[39] Ineludibly, owing to the nature of San Jose Del Monte as a lone legislative district, the qualified voters therein have the right to elect their own representatives in the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as much as they have the right to be represented in the House of Representatives. Stated otherwise, it cannot remain clustered with the municipalities or cities in the fourth legislative district of Bulacan for purposes of electing its board members. Finally, given that the basis of the prayer for the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction is inextricably intertwined with the postulations raised in the main Petition, the Court finds no necessity to belabor the same. IN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS, the Urgent Petition for Mandamus with Prayer for Preliminary Mandatory Injunction is hereby GRANTED. A Writ of Mandamus is ISSUED, DIRECTING the Commission on Elections to AMEND Section 6 of Resolution No. 10707 to conform with Section 41(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 by allocating two seats in the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the Province of Bulacan for the lone legislative district of San Jose Del Monte.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.",6/14/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69109,THIRD DIVISION,DIMAAMPAO,"Hence, at most, only the seizures on February 20, 2013 and March 1, 2013 would be hinged on the validity of the Revenue Memorandum Circular. Prior thereto, the tax treatment of minerals extracted by petitioner from the Didipio Project would have been governed by BIR Ruling No. 10-2007. Thus, the seizure and detention that occurred on February 11 and 12, 2013, covered by Apprehension Slips No. 00013426 and 00013427, should have been appreciated independently by the CTA in determining whether it still had jurisdiction over the remaining issues of the case. It is an elementary principle that ""jurisdiction of the court over a subject matter is conferred only by the Constitution or by law as well as determined by the allegations in the complaint and the character of the relief sought.""[56]On this score, some clarification is necessary. Although the apprehension and seizure that occurred on February 11 and 12, 2013 should be appreciated as a separate matter from the issue regarding the validity of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 17-2013, these are likewise covered by the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies.The BIR's power to search vehicles and seize excisable articles flow from Sections 171 and 172 of the Tax Code:SECTION 171. Authority of Internal Revenue Officer in Searching for Taxable Articles.‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Any internal revenue officer may, in the discharge of his official duties, enter any house, building or place where articles subject to tax under this Title are produced or kept, or are believed by him upon reasonable grounds to be produced or kept, so far as may be necessary to examine, discover or seize the same.He may also stop and search any vehicle or other means of transportation when upon reasonable grounds he believes that the same carries any article on which the excise tax has not been paid.SECTION 172. Detention of Package Containing Taxable Articles.‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Any revenue officer may detain any package containing or supposed to contain articles subject to excise tax when he has good reason to believe that the lawful tax has not been paid or that the package has been or is being removed in violation of law, and every such package shall be held by such officer in a safe place until it shall be determined whether the property so detained is liable by law to be proceeded against for forfeiture; but such summary detention shall not continue in any case longer than seven (7) days without due process of law or intervention of the officer to whom such detention is to be reported.The foregoing provisions grant this authority, however, to revenue officers. Indeed, an examination of the Apprehension Slips[57] subject of this case would reveal that they are signed under the authority of mere revenue officers.However, only matters decided by respondent or his duly authorized representative[58] are subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the CTA. This is clear from the express wording of Section 4 of the Tax Code in relation to Section 7(a)(1), Republic Act (RA) No. 1125,[59] as amended:[60]Tax CodeSECTION 4. Power of the Commissioner to Interpret Tax Laws and to Decide Tax Cases.‚Äö√Ñ√Æ The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance.The power to decide disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under this Code or other laws or portions thereof administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue is vested in the Commissioner, subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)RA No. 1125, as amendedSEC. 7. Jurisdiction. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ The CTA shall exercise:(a) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:(1) Decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue;.... (Emphasis supplied) Rationally, the apprehension and seizure done pursuant to Sections 171 and 172 of the Tax Code would more properly fall under the purview of ""other matters"" in the aforecited provisions, rather than to be considered some form of assessment or penalty per se. Nevertheless, it is only the decision of respondent, or his duly authorized representative, on such matters which is appealable to the CTA, and certainly not the act of the revenue officers in the first instance.Petitioner itself seemed to recognize this when it protested the detention of its minerals on December 7, 2012, covered by Apprehension Slip No. 00013424, before the Regional Director of the BIR Revenue Region No. 3 and the Revenue District Officer of the BIR Revenue District No. 14.[61]Thus, strictly speaking, petitioner should have first filed a protest for the seizure and detention of its copper concentrates, prior to seeking judicial relief before the CTA.Despite the foregoing, there is sufficient reason to relax the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies. Jurisprudence teaches that the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies admits of certain exceptions such as:[62] (1) when there is a violation of due process; (2) when the issue involved is purely a legal question; (3) when the administrative action is patently illegal amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; (4) when there is estoppel on the part of the administrative agency concerned; (5) when there is irreparable injury; (6) when the respondent is a department secretary whose acts as an alter ego of the President bears the implied and assumed approval of the latter; (7) when to require exhaustion of administrative remedies would be unreasonable; (8) when it would amount to a nullification of a claim; (9) when the subject matter is a private land in land case proceedings; (10) when the rule does not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy; or (11) when there are circumstances indicating the urgency of judicial intervention.[62] Several exceptions appear to be present in this case, particularly the first and fourth exceptions which apply to the case arising from the seizure and detention of copper concentrates occurring on February 11 and 12, 2013, as well as the resulting illegal exaction of excise taxes therefrom. The eleventh exception applies with regard to the three causes raised, i.e., the seizure and detention of copper concentrates, the illegal collection of excise taxes, and the validity of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 17-2013.As to the first and fourth exceptions, as above discussed, prior to the issuance of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 17-2013, petitioner had a right to rely on BIR Ruling No. 10-2007. In disregarding this ruling, respondent appears to have effectively applied Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 17-2013 retroactively in contravention of Section 246[63] of the Tax Code when it made the seizure and detention on February 11 and 12, 2013. Indeed, petitioner does not seem to have been afforded sufficient due process when the BIR suddenly changed its position anent the taxability of minerals extracted pursuant to Financial or Technical Assistance Agreements with the government during the recovery period. It has also been recognized that the application of Section 246 against the BIR is a form of equitable estoppel.[64]In relation to the eleventh exception, the potential breach of petitioner's contractual obligations with its buyer owing to every shipment of copper concentrates being detained by the BIR, as a result of applying Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 17-2013, supports the urgency of judicial intervention.[65]Thus, petitioner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies, with either the challenge against the seizure and detention of its copper concentrates or against Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 17-2013, can be excused in this instance.As to petitioner's prayer for the reinstatement of a Suspension Order in its favor, suffice to say that this matter is best left to the determination of the CTA.All in all, the interests of substantive justice would be better served if the assailed rulings of the CTA were set aside and the parties were afforded the opportunity to ventilate and prove their respective claims in a full-blown trial.THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated June 16, 2016 and the Resolution dated September 22, 2017 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1222 are SET ASIDE.

WINSTON CLARK STOLK, SR., RESPONDENT.",6/26/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69394,SECOND DIVISION,KHO,"Accordingly, the RTC committed grave jurisdictional error when it dismissed petitioners' appeal for failure to pay the required fees within the appeal period. To emphasize, there is nothing in the Rules that require the simultaneous payment of the appellate court fees and filing of the Notice of Appeal to perfect an appeal. So long as both the filing and payment requirements are duly complied with within the appeal period, the appeal must be deemed perfected even if the docket and other lawful fees were paid days after the notice of appeal was filed, as in this case.III.Under Rule 41, Section 1[73] of the Rules of Court, an order disallowing or dismissing an appeal may be assailed via a petition for certiorari which, under Rule 65, Section 4[74] of the same Rules, shall be filed within 60 days from notice of the judgment, order, or resolution. In this case, petitioners received a copy of the RTC's August 26, 2016 Order, which denied their motion for reconsideration from the RTC's Order dismissing their Notice of Appeal on March 9, 2017. Since petitioners filed their certiorari petition only on July 28, 2017, the 60-day reglementary period under Rule 65, Section 4 had manifestly expired resulting in the dismissal of said petition for being filed out of time and rendering the assailed Order final and executory.While the CA may have correctly determined that the Petition for Certiorari was filed out of time, its grave legal error arises from the fact that it failed to recognize the grave jurisdictional errors that attended the RTC's dismissal of petitioner's Notice of Appeal for failure to timely pay the appellate court docket and other lawful fees. If only to underscore this relevant point, there is nothing in the Rules that require the simultaneous payment of the appellate court fees and filing of the notice of appeal in order that the appeal is perfected. So long as both the filing and payment requirements are duly complied with within the appeal period, the appeal must be deemed perfected even if the docket and other lawful fees were paid days after the notice of appeal was filed. Thus, whether counted from November 14, 2014, i.e., the service of the November 4, 2014 Order on one of the petitioners, or from December 3, 2014, i.e., receipt by petitioners' counsel of the November 4, 2014 Order, petitioners' appeal was duly perfected within the 15-day reglementary period for appeal.On this score, it bears stressing that in all questions relating to the care, custody, education, and property of the children, the latter's welfare is paramount. Considering the weight of the issues and interests involved in this case, it behooved the CA to relax procedural rules especially in situations where, as in this case, grave jurisdictional errors attended the assailed rulings of the RTC. Grave abuse of discretion has been defined as a ""capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment that is patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law.""[75] Case law provides that grave abuse of discretion exists when an act is: (1) done contrary to the Constitution, the law, or jurisprudence; or (2) executed whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily, out of malice, ill will, or personal bias.[76] The RTC's actions manifestly violated legal and procedural edicts in such arbitrary and capricious disregard of Winston's best interest.It is settled that rules of procedure should be so construed as to give effect rather than defeat their essence.[77] Clearly, the best interest of the minor Winston in this case justified liberality in the interpretation of the Rules to achieve substantial justice, which the CA equally erroneously ignored. Special circumstances exist that warranted exception from the Rule on immutability of judgments Moreover, while it is settled that once a judgment attains finality, it becomes immutable and unalterable, and thus, may no longer be modified in any respect, even by the highest Court of the land,[78] this Rule admits of exceptions. Certainly, the Court recognizes the significance of this doctrine, grounded as it is on the fundamental principle of public policy and sound practice that, at the risk of occasional error, the judgment of courts and the award of quasi-judicial agencies must become final on some definite date fixed by law.[79]Nonetheless, substantial justice may warrant relaxation of this rigid rule in matters involving: (i) matters of life, liberty, honor, or property; (ii) the existence of special or compelling circumstances; (iii) the merits of the case; (iv) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules; (v) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; or (vi) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.[80] Case law has also relaxed the application of the doctrine in situations involving: correction of clerical errors, or the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party; void judgments; and whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision which render its execution unjust and inequitable.[81] Verily, when extraordinary circumstances exist, the Court has the inherent power and discretion to set aside technicalities in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction and amend, modify, or reconsider a final judgment when necessary to fully serve the demands of substantial justice.[82]Applying the foregoing principles, the Court finds that the existence of special or compelling circumstances, such as the grave jurisdictional error committed by the RTC, the merits of this case, and a lack of showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory, including the lack of showing that respondent will be prejudiced thereby, merited a relaxation of the rule on immutability of judgments. These reasons should have compelled the CA to relax procedural niceties. Lest it be forgotten, the rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid, technical sense, for they have been adopted to help secure‚Äö√Ñ√Ænot override‚Äö√Ñ√Æsubstantial justice.[83]IV. Article 176, 214, and 216 of the Family Code apply in this case In addition to the foregoing, the Court likewise finds that the RTC committed such grave and arbitrary legal error in relying on the provisions of Articles 212 and 213 of the Family Code in awarding respondent custody over Winston.The right of custody accorded to parents spring from the exercise of parental authority. Parental authority or patria potestas in Roman Law, is the juridical institution whereby parents rightfully assume control and protection of their unemancipated children to the extent required by the latter's needs. It is a mass of rights and obligations which the law grants to parents for the purpose of the children's physical preservation and development, as well as the cultivation of their intellect and the education of their heart and senses.[84]As a rule, the father and the mother shall jointly exercise parental authority over the persons of their common children. However, with respect to illegitimate children, Article 176[85] of the Family Code explicitly grants the sole parental authority to the mother, notwithstanding the father's recognition of the child.[86] In the exercise of that authority, mothers are consequently entitled to keep their illegitimate children in their company, and the Court will not deprive them of custody, absent any imperative cause showing the mother's unfitness to exercise such authority and care.[87]In case of the death, absence, or unsuitability of the parents or the mother in the case of illegitimate children, substitute parental authority shall be exercised by the surviving grandparent pursuant to Article 214 of the Family Code, or to the specified persons in the order provided under Article 216 thereof. These provisions read:Article 214. In case of death, absence or unsuitability of the parents, substitute parental authority shall be exercised by the surviving grandparent. In case several survive, the one designated by the court, taking into account the same consideration mentioned in the preceding article, shall exercise the authority.Article 216. In default of parents or a judicially appointed guardian, the following person shall exercise substitute parental authority over the child in the order indicated:(1) The surviving grandparent, as provided in Art. 214;(2) The oldest brother or sister, over twenty-one years of age, unless unfit or disqualified; and (3) The child's actual custodian, over twenty-one years of age, unless unfit or disqualified.Whenever the appointment or a judicial guardian over the property of the child becomes necessary, the same order of preference shall be observed. (Emphasis supplied)Notably, as the foregoing provisions read, it would appear that substitute parental authority is granted to the grandparents or the specified persons only in case of death, absence, or unsuitability of both parents. Thus, in situations where only one parent dies, is absent, or found unsuitable, Articles 214 and 216 would find no application.It must be clarified, however, that the foregoing interpretation finds application only in situations where the father and mother jointly exercise parental authority over the persons of their common children as provided under Article 211 of the Family Code. Where, however, the parental authority is granted solely to the mother as in the case of illegitimate children, the substitute parental authority shall be exercised by the grandparents or the specified persons as provided under Article 214 and 216 of the Family Code, in case of the mother's death, absence, or unsuitability. Indeed, to read otherwise would effectively permit circumvention of the legislative intent to grant sole parental authority to the mother with respect to their illegitimate children.Nonetheless, the foregoing clarification should not be understood to disqualify the father of illegitimate children automatically and absolutely from exercising substitute parental authority in case of the death, absence, or unsuitability of the mother. Indeed, case law[88] in fact recognized that the father of an illegitimate child may exercise substitute parental authority and be given custody in situations where he is the ""child's actual custodian,"" as provided under Article 216 of the Family Code.Ultimately, in all questions involving the care and custody of minors, it is axiomatic that their welfare and well-being is always the paramount consideration.[89] For this reason, Section 14 of the Rule on Custody of Minors enumerated factors that must be considered in determining the issues of custody. These include: the child's material and moral welfare, health, and safety; the nature and frequency of contact with both parents; habitual use of alcohol, dangerous drugs, or regulated substances; the most suitable physical, emotional, spiritual, psychological, and educational environment for the holistic development and growth of the minor; and the preference of the minor over seven years of age and of sufficient discernment, unless the parent chosen is unfit. Section 14 reads in full:Section 14. Factors to consider in determining custody. ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ In awarding custody, the court shall consider the best interests of the minor and shall give paramount consideration to his material and moral welfare. The best interests of the minor refer to the totality of the circumstances and conditions as are most congenial to the survival, protection, and feelings of security of the minor encouraging to his physical, psychological and emotional development. It also means the least detrimental available alternative for safeguarding the growth and development of the minor.The court shall also consider the following:(a) Any extrajudicial agreement which the parties may have bound themselves to comply with respecting the rights of the minor to maintain direct contact with the non custodial parent on a regular basis, except when there is an existing threat or danger or physical, mental, sexual or emotional violence which endangers the safety and best interests of the minor;(b) The desire and ability of one parent to foster an open and loving relationship between the minor and the other parent;(c) The health, safety and welfare of the minor;(d) Any history of child or spousal abuse by the person seeking custody or who has had any filial relationship with the minor, including anyone courting the parent;(e) The nature and frequency of contact with both parents;(f) Habitual use of alcohol, dangerous drugs or regulated substances;(g) Marital misconduct;(h) The most suitable physical, emotional, spiritual, psychological and educational environment for the holistic development and growth of the minor; and(i) The preference of the minor over seven years of age and of sufficient discernment, unless the parent chosen is unfit. (Emphasis supplied)Additionally, to effectively and thoroughly facilitate the Court's determination of circumstances and conditions that may affect the best interest of the minor, Section 8 of the Rule on Custody of Minors authorize courts to order the conduct of a case study, viz:Section 8. Case study; duty of social worker. ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Upon the filing of the verified answer or the expiration of the period to file it, the court may order a social worker to make a case study of the minor and the parties and to submit a report and recommendation to the court at least three days before the scheduled pre-trial. (Underscoring supplied)In this regard, it bears pointing out that while Section 8 of Rule on Custody of Minors uses the word ""may"" with respect to the conduct of a case study, and thus, subject to the discretion of the trial courts, the same must be exercised with the best interest of the minor always in mind. Thus, courts do not have unbridled discretion to dispense with the conduct of a case study especially when facts and circumstances are presented that may prove detrimental for the safeguarding of the minor's growth and development. To the Court's mind, Sections 8 and 14 of the Rule on Custody of Minors were incorporated to additionally arm the courts with the appropriate guidelines and tools to ascertain, with more or less sufficient definiteness, the most congenial situation for the survival, protection, and feelings of security of minors encouraging to their physical, psychological, and emotional development.In this case, it is undisputed that Catherine was not married to respondent. Thus, the sole parental authority, including custody, over her illegitimate son, Winston, resided with her pursuant to Article 176 of the Family Code. Upon Catherine's death, the collateral grandparents of Winston took actual custody of the latter and exercised parental authority over him pursuant to Articles 214 and 216 of the same Code.To be sure, the grant of substitute parental authority that includes custody to petitioners under Articles 214 and 216 of the Family Code is not final and absolute. As with support, the determination of who will exercise substitute parental authority and custody over a minor is not final and irrevocable.[90] It may be subject to the proper determination of a court of competent jurisdiction, taking into consideration, among others, the parameters enumerated in Section 14 of the Rule on Custody of Minors, and the various measures provided under existing laws and rules, such as the conduct of a case study, in order to effectively and thoroughly facilitate the determination of the most suitable environment for the well-being and safety of the minor.Here, there is undeniably an apparent dearth of supporting reasons in the trial court's ruling with respect to the existence of such facts, circumstances, and conditions that is most congenial for Winston's survival, protection, and feelings of security encouraging to his physical, psychological, and emotional development. Indeed, the RTC ruling failed to consider such factors enumerated in Section 14 of the Rule on Custody of Minors as the ""health, safety and welfare of [Winston],"" the ""habitual use of alcohol, dangerous drugs or regulated substances,"" the ""most suitable physical, emotional, spiritual, psychological and educational environment for [Winston's] holistic development and growth,"" and ""Winston's preference,"" including any circumstances that may be detrimental to Winston's growth and development, in resolving to award custody to respondent.In the Court's view, the RTC's, overreliance on the evidence of respondent's parentage in awarding custody over Winston constituted grave jurisdictional error or such whimsical, capricious, and arbitrary exercise of discretion. Not only does this ruling violate the express legal provision granting parental authority to the mother with respect to illegitimate children and in case of her death, to the persons specifically authorized to exercise substitute parental authority. More importantly, such error effectively amounted to an abandonment of its legal and moral duty to rule in the best interest of the minor. It bears reemphasizing that the law and the Rules mandate that the best interest of the minor must be the primordial consideration in the determination of who should rightfully exercise custody and parental authority.V.All told, the Court finds that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in awarding respondent custody over Winston based solely on parentage. Consequently, the CA committed reversible error in dismissing outright the Petition for Certiorari filed by petitioners from the said RTC ruling on procedural grounds. For these reasons, the Court deems it proper to remand the case to the court a quo for the resolution of the case with dispatch, taking into consideration, among others, the factors and measures provided under the Rule on Custody of Minors.A word of caution. The foregoing pronouncement should not be interpreted to imply a preference toward petitioners relative to the custody of the minor, Winston, nor should it be taken to mean as a statement against respondent's fitness to have custody over his son. It shall be only understood that, for the present and until appropriately and finally adjudged, the custody over Winston pendente lite may not be properly awarded to respondent.FOR THESE REASONS, the Court resolves to PARTIALLY GRANT the instant Petition. The assailed Resolutions dated August 23, 2017 and October 9, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 151807 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

G.R. No. 245894,"RAQUEL C. MELLORIA, MUNICIPAL ACCOUNTANT, EDUARDA A. CASADOR, MUNICIPAL TREASURER, MUNICIPALITY OF LAAK, PROVINCE OF COMPOSTELA VALLEY, PETITIONERS, VS. DIRECTOR FLERIDA A. JIMENEZ, IN HER CAPACITY AS HEAD, INTELLIGENCE AND CONFIDENTIAL FUNDS AUDIT UNIT, OFFICE OF THE CHAIRPERSON, AND COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENTS.",7/11/23,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69135,EN BANC,DIMAAMPAO,"In view of the foregoing discussion, the Court pronounces:....2. If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules on return are as follows:a. Approving and certifying officers who acted in good faith, in regular performance of official functions, and with the diligence of a good father of the family are not civilly liable to return consistent with Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987[.] (Emphasis supplied)In the disputed transaction, Melloria, as the municipal accountant, ce1iified that the allotment was obligated for the purpose, while Casador, as the municipal treasurer, certified the availability of funds. It can be easily distilled that petitioners were merely performing ministerial functions not related to the legality or illegality of the disbursement. These are ministerial functions that officers must perform with respect to a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to or exercise of their own judgment.[39] A duty is ministerial when the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor judgment.[40]In Celeste v. Commission on Audit,[41] the Court has previously held that officials whose participation is limited to certifying the availability of funds or completeness of supporting documents are presumed to have acted in good faith because they were merely attesting to facts based on their records. Also, in Alejandrino v. Commission on Audit,[42] the Court explained that the certifying officers' participation in the disallowed transaction is ministerial because they could not have refused to certify to these matters if they were true. The Court ruled that officers who were only performing duties that can be considered ministerial could not be held personally liable for disallowances if they were not involved in policymaking or decision-making concerning the disallowed transaction.Being mere certifying officers, petitioners do not appear to have a hand in deciding the upper limit of the intelligence and confidential funds or which activities could be charged against the intelligence and confidential funds, or that through the exercise of their functions as certifiers, they could have prevented the cash advances drawn by the Municipal Mayor upon whom the responsibility for the execution of the local budget is primarily vested as the local chief executive.In pr‚àö¬©cis, petitioners acted in good faith and may be excused from the solidary liability to return the disallowed amounts, consistent with Rule 2(a) of the Rules of Return in Madera.THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, the Petition for Certiorari filed by petitioners Raquel C. Melloria, and Eduarda A. Casador is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED. The assailed Decision Nos. 2018-007 and 2019-008 of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.Petitioners Raquel C. Melloria, and Eduarda A. Casador, are EXCUSED from returning the disallowed amounts in Notice of Disallowance No. 2014-12-0013, having acted in good faith.SO ORDERED.

However, this reasoning is illogical and simply does not follow. By petitioner's own admission, the reason Angel never posted a security was not because of his inability, but because of their ""harmonious contractual relations."" Thence, this could not serve as basis to comply with the third requisite.As a final point, and as an added badge of grave error on the part of the trial court, the Court likewise wholly concurs with the CA that the amount that the RTC ordered to be attached was excessive.[60] As pointed out by the CA, petitioner was primarily seeking to cover at least its principal claim of P4,846,555.84,[61] but the RTC erroneously included all the amounts sought by petitioner, even those corresponding to the claimed actual and compensatory damages, moral and exemplary damages, and nominal damages. Realizing its error, the RTC even amended the original May 17, 2019 Order by excluding the moral and exemplary damages from the coverage of the Writ.[62]The Court takes this occasion to sternly remind the lower courts that a writ of attachment should not be issued for unliquidated or contingent claims and should, as a general rule, be confined to the principal claim.[63] The rationale is to avoid excessive attachments that would unduly prejudice and, in some cases, financially cripple the debtor or defendant even before the main issues of the controversy have been resolved.The P75,000,000.00 in nominal damages sought as expected profits for 10 years relating to the fourth site that never materialized, despite the fact that the said arrangement was not even covered by a contract in writing, is the very definition of an unliquidated claim, i.e., one that cannot be established with reasonable certainty.[64] In including this amount, the RTC issued an excessive and unconscionable writ.Ineluctably, the RTC gravely erred in denying respondents' motion to discharge the subject Writ of Preliminary Attachment.THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.

MEDIAN CONTAINER CORPORATION AND ELDON INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.",2/5/24,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69560,SECOND DIVISION,KHO,"Accordingly, being permissive, PNB's counterclaim required the payment of docket fees and a certificate of non-forum shopping with its counterclaim. Case law settles that for the trial court to acquire jurisdiction, the counterclaimant must comply with the requirements for initiatory pleadings. This includes payment of the required docket fees within the reglementary or prescriptive period and filing of a certificate of non-forum shopping with its counterclaim. The failure to comply with these requisites will justify the trial court in dismissing the permissive counterclaim for failure to acquire jurisdiction.[40]In this case, there is nothing in the records that show that PNB paid the required docket fees and filed the certificate of non-forum shopping with its counterclaim within the reglementary or prescriptive period. Moreover, despite the RTC's ruling finding its counterclaim permissive, PNB simply reiterated its position that the same is compulsory in its motion for reconsideration without any attempt to comply with the foregoing requisites. In fact, PNB simply reiterated the same arguments before the CA, in its Petition for Certiorari, as it charged the RTC with grave abuse of discretion in dismissing its permissive counterclaim. Notably, it is only after the CA dismissed its Petition for Certiorari that PNB claimed the lack of opportunity given by the RTC for it to pay the docket fees before its counterclaim was dismissed. Had it believed that it should have at least been given an opportunity to comply with the said requisites, it should have outrightly argued the same in its motion for reconsideration before the RTC to correct the perceived jurisdictional error.Relatedly, since PNB's motion to implead Spouses Ley was anchored on its permissive counterclaim, the Court rules that the dismissal of the latter factually and logically carried the denial of said motion. Under these circumstances, the Court is hard-pressed to conclude that the CA reversibly erred in dismissing PNB's petition for certiorari.Grave abuse of discretion has been defined as such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, or the exercise of power in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility. The abuse must be in a manner so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility.[41]Other than its bare assertions and insinuations that its counterclaim is compulsory, PNB failed to clearly demonstrate and substantiate the alleged grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC. As the certiorari petitioner before the CA, PNB was bound to show that in dismissing its permissive counterclaim, the RTC acted in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility, or in a manner so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law. PNB's failure to discharge its burden of proving grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC justified the CA in dismissing its Petition for Certiorari.All told, the Court finds that PNB's counterclaim is permissive. As such, the CA did not commit any reversible error in dismissing the petition for certiorari before it for failing to show grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in dismissing PNB's permissive counterclaim. Consequently, the Court is constrained to deny the petition.FOR THESE REASONS, the Court resolves to DENY the Petition for Review on Certiorari. The Decision dated March 19, 2014 and the Resolution dated August 18, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 121782 are hereby AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED. M. Lopez and J.

A.M. No. 24-02-09-SC,RE: DRAFT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE-NATIONAL PROSECUTION SERVICE'S [DOJNPS] RULES ON PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS AND INQUEST PROCEEDINGS,5/28/24,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69517,EN BANC,ZALAMEDA,"therefore, not a judicial function. It is a part of the prosecution's job, a function of the executive.[27] (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted.)This pronouncement was reiterated m the 1997 case of People v. Navarro,[28] where the Court has held:It must be stressed that preliminary investigation is an executive, not a judicial, function. As the officer authorized to direct and control the prosecution of all criminal actions, a prosecutor is primarily responsible for ascertaining whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.[29]By reason of this shift in the nature of preliminary investigation, the Court has adopted a policy of non-interference in the public prosecutor's conduct thereof.For instance, in People v. Navarro,[30] it was held that a trial court ""cannot directly order an assistant prosecutor to, particularly over the objections of the latter's superiors, to conduct a preliminary investigation,"" because to allow the court to do so is to ""authorize [the court] to meddle in the executive and administrative functions of the provincial or city prosecutor."" Most noteworthy, however, was the Court's ruling in Chan y Lim v. Secretary of Justice,[31] where it was held:Albeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non¬¨‚â†interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion.[32] (Emphasis supplied.)Considering the nature of preliminary investigations, and the Court's policy on non-interference in the conduct thereof, the Court resolves to recognize the authority of the DOJ to promulgate its own rules on preliminary investigation. Indeed, it is within the DOJ's prerogative to direct and control the conduct of preliminary investigations, and the Court will not interfere with the same so long as it not tainted with grave abuse of discretion.Further, to obviate any obstacle in the DOJ's implementation of the DOJ-NPS Rules, the Court resolves to repeal the provisions of Rule 112 of the 2000 Rules that are inconsistent therewith. It must be stressed that the promulgation of the DOJ-NPS Rules would not ipso facto repeal Rule 112 of the 2000 Rules.In Estipona v. Hon. Lobrigo,[33] the Court held that the power to promulgate rules of pleading, practice, and procedure is now within its exclusive domain and no longer shared with the Executive and Legislative departments, and that the Court could assert its discretion to amend, repeal, or even establish new rules of procedure, to the exclusion of these branches of government.Thus, it is settled that only the Court could repeal Rule 112 of the 2000 Rules. Nevertheless, to remove the impediment that the present Rule 112 seems to impose upon the promulgation of the DOJ-NPS Rules, and in recognition of the DOJ's authority to promulgate its own rules on preliminary investigation, the repeal of the pertinent provisions under Rule 112 of the 2000 Rules inconsistent with the DOJ-NPS is warranted.The repeal, however, is without prejudice to the Court's promulgation of its own procedure, of a new rule touching upon preliminary investigation. In fact, the Sub-Committee for the Revision of the Rules on Criminal Procedure proposes a new version of Rule 112. This version contains: (1) definitions of preliminary investigation and inquest, (2) an acknowledgment that the conduct of preliminary investigation is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DOJ, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Commission on Elections, and other officers as may be authorized by law, and (3) other provisions not inconsistent with the proposed DOJ-NPS Rules. The same was introduced because the Sub-Committee recognizes that other government agencies also conduct preliminary investigations, which will not be covered by the DOJ-NPS Rules.FOR THESE REASONS, the Court hereby RECOGNIZES the AUTHORITY of the Department of Justice to promulgate its 2024 DOJ¬¨‚â† National Prosecution Service Rules on Preliminary Investigations and Inquest Proceedings (2024 DOJ-NPS Rules).Thereafter, and once the 2024 DOJ-NPS Rules are promulgated by the DOJ, the pertinent provisions of Rule 112 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, inconsistent therewith are deemed REPEALED. This shall be without prejudice to the Court's promulgation of its own rules of procedure, of a new rule touching upon preliminary investigation, consistent with the 2024 DOJ- NPS Rules.Let a copy of the 2024 DOJ-NPS Rules be endorsed to the Sub¬¨‚â† Committee on the Revision of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for its guidance and appropriate action.SO ORDERED.

SALVADOR, FOR HERSELF AND IN REPRESENTATION OF THE MINORS ALEXIS SALVADOR, JEFFREY SALVADOR, ANTHONY SALVADOR, AND HYACINTH SALVADOR YEE, RESPONDENTS.",5/29/24,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69580,THIRD DIVISION,SINGH,"therefore, finds that the RTC and CA were correct in maintaining that he is an heir of Anatolio.As a final issue, Juanito, et al. asserted that the RTC erred in ordering that the subject properties be reconveyed to Maria, et al., since at most they are entitled to only one-half of Anatolio's estate. The Court agrees. To determine the appropriate share to be awarded to Maria, et al., the applicable law is the Spanish Civil Code, since Anatolio died in 1944.[45] The Spanish Civil Code provides as follows:ARTICLE 807. The following are forced heirs:1. Legitimate children and descendants, with respect to their legitimate parents and descendants;. . . .ARTICLE 808. The legitime of legitimate children and descendants consists of two-thirds of the hereditary estate of the father and of the mother.Nevertheless, they may dispose of one of the two thirds forming the legitime in order to apply it as a betterment to their legitimate children or descendants.They may freely dispose of the remaining third.. . . .ARTICLE 834. A widower or widow who, on the death of his or her spouse, is not divorced, or should be so by the fault of the deceased, shall be entitled to a portion in usufruct equal to that corresponding by way of legitime to each of the legitimate children or descendants who has not received any betterment.If only one legitimate child or descendant survives, the widower or widow shall have the usufruct of the third available for betterment, such child or descendant to have the naked ownership until, on the death of the surviving spouse, the whole title is merged in him [or her].If the spouses should be separated by a suit for divorce, the result of the suit shall be awaited.If there should have been a pardon or a reconciliation between the divorced spouses, the survivor shall preserve his or her rights. Considering the foregoing, upon Anatolio's death, two-thirds of his estate was automatically transferred to his surviving legitimate children, Juanito and Franklin. As to the remaining one-third portion, Juanito and Franklin acquired its naked ownership while the widow, Rosario, enjoyed a usufruct. Upon Rosario's death, full ownership over the entirety of Anatolio's estate was vested in Juanito and Franklin. In effect all of Anatolio's estate will be divided in two, Juanito and Franklin each taking half. Upon Franklin's death in 2000, his share in Anatolio's estate was inherited by his heirs pursuant to the provisions of the Family Code and the Civil Code of the Philippines.It should be pointed out that while the records show that the parties and the lower courts assumed that Juanito, et al. and Maria, et al. are the only rightful claimants of these properties, there appears no definitive finding on this issue. A close reading of the records shows that Juanito testified that the properties originally belonged to Anatolio's parents. These properties were already divided between Anatolio and his sister, although no partition or settlement of estate was presented. Juanito also testified on re-¬¨‚â†direct examination that Rosario had other children with her second husband, Celedonio Salvador, but again no evidence was presented to support this assertion. Neither the RTC nor the CA provided any discussion on the existence or rights of these alleged heirs.Moreover, the lower courts made no determination as to whether or not the subject properties belong solely to Anatolio or to the conjugal partnership of his marriage. In the case of conjugal partnership, the properties of Anatolio and Rosario would have to be divided equally between the spouses in accordance with the Spanish Civil Code before passing down to their respective heirs.[46]The Court finds that the parties are co-owners of the subject properties, however, the reconveyance may only proceed after partition. The record shows that Maria, et al. filed a case for ""Declaration of Nullity of Documents, Reconveyance of Property, Partition, Recovery of Possession, Quieting of Title and Damages with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction,"" although they did not mention partition their prayer.[47] In its ruling, RTC confined itself to the reliefs prayed for, without ordering partition. Nevertheless, a partition of the properties is necessary before the parties can effect the Order for Reconveyance, as held in Reyes v. Spouses Garcia:[48]The spouses Garcia and all the co-owners cannot adjudicate to himself or herself title to any definite portion of the subject property until its actual partition by agreement or judicial decree. In Carvajal v. Court of Appeals, which We reiterated in Heirs of Jarque v. Jarque, We ruled that:The action for ejectment and recovery of possession instituted by herein respondents in the lower court is premature, for what must be settled first is the action for partition. Unless a project of partition is effected, each heir cannot claim ownership over a definite portion of the inheritance. Without partition, either by agreement between the parties or by judicial proceeding, a co-heir cannot dispose of a specific portion of the estate. For where there are two or more heirs, the whole estate of the decedent is, before its partition, owned in common by such heirs. Upon the death of a person, each of his [or her] heirs becomes the undivided owner of the whole estate left with respect to the part or portion which might be adjudicated to him [or her], a community of ownership being thus formed among the co-owners of the estate or co-heirs while it remains undivided.While under Article 493 of the New Civil Code, each co-owner shall have the full ownership of his [or her] part and of the fruits and benefits pertaining thereto and he [or she] may alienate, assign or mortgage it, and even substitute another person in its enjoyment, the effect of the alienation or the mortgage with respect to the co-owners, shall be limited, by mandate of the same article, to the portion which may be allotted to him [or her] in the division upon the termination of the co-ownership. He [or She] has no right to sell or alienate a concrete, specific, or determinate part of the thing in common to the exclusion of the other co-owners because his [or her] right over the thing is represented by an abstract or ideal portion without any physical adjudication. An individual co-owner cannot adjudicate to himself [or herself] or claim title to any definite portion of the land or thing owned in common until its actual partition by agreement or judicial decree. Prior to that time all that the co-owner has is an ideal or abstract quota or proportionate share in the entire thing owned in common by all the co-owners. What a co-owner may dispose of is only his [or her] undivided aliquot share, which shall be limited to the portion that may be allotted to him [or her] upon partition. Before partition, a co-heir can only sell his [or her] successional rights.[49] (Emphasis in the original) Generally, a special civil action for partition cannot be joined with an ordinary civil action for reconveyance.[50] However, erroneously joined causes of action may be resolved together provided the parties did not object and no severance order has been issued by the court.[51] Now, even if the Complaint did not specifically pray for partition, Maria, et al. are claiming a share of the subject properties by asserting Franklin's rights as an heir of Anatolio. These claims suffice to establish a cause of action for partition.[52] Thus, and as this Court so orders, the partition and reconveyance should be carried out by the RTC in order to fully resolve the case at hand.FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision, dated March 30, 2017, and the Resolution, dated August 25, 2017, of the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R.

A bare allegation in the complaint regarding the absence of a record of the deed of conveyance with the Register of Deeds of Isabela is insufficient. At all events, for an action for reconveyance based on fraud to prosper, the plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence not only his or her title to the property, but also the fact of fraud. Fraud is never presumed;[63] mere allegations of fraud are not enough. Intentional acts to deceive and deprive another of his or her right, or in some manner, injure him or her, must be specifically alleged and proved.[64] The foregoing was reiterated by the Court in the case of Flores v. Bagaoisan[65] as follows: In order that an action for reconveyance based on fraud may prosper, it is essential for the party seeking reconveyance to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, his title to the property and the fact of fraud. Respondent did not allege in his complaint or prove during the trial that fraud attended the registration of the subject property in petitioners' names. In fact, there was no allegation as to how petitioners were able to secure title to the property despite the alleged ownership of respondent's predecessor.[66] At this point, it must be underscored that the Heirs of Tulauan did not even allege that they have in their possession the owner's duplicate copy of OCT No. P-1080. In fact, they admitted in their complaint that as early as in the 1950s, Teodoro already left Santiago, Isabela, and resided in Tuguegarao for security reasons. Purportedly, it was only when one of his children, who was abroad, went for a vacation in the Philippines that they discovered the land being developed by a real estate developer.[67] Nonetheless, the complaint did not even specify the time when such alleged discovery took place. Also, it did not even state what happened to Teodoro after leaving Santiago City and the impossibility of him voluntarily executing a deed of conveyance covering the subject property. Verily, the mere fact that the Heirs of Tulauan were unaware of any conveyance made by their predecessor-in-interest does not automatically lead to the conclusion that any document executed in relation to the subject property is dubious, fraudulent, or a forgery. FOR THESE REASONS, the Motions for Reconsideration filed by respondents Communities Isabela, Inc. and Magdalena Mateo Lorenzo are GRANTED. The Decision of the Court promulgated on September 7, 2022, is hereby SET ASIDE. The Decision dated July 31, 2018, and the Resolution dated July 15, 2019, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107610 are AFFIRMED. The complaint for reconveyance filed by petitioners Heirs of Teodoro Tulauan in Civil Case No. 36-3826 filed before Branch 36, Regional Trial Court, Santiago City is DISMISSED for failure to state a cause of action.

Pursuant to Article XII, Section 31(f) of Republic Act No. 7610,[135] accused-appellant should also be penalized with a fine set by this Court at PHP 15,000.00.[136] In addition, jurisprudence provides that accused-appellant is civilly liable to pay AAA270317: (1) PHP 50,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) PHP 50,000.00 as exemplary damages.[137]As for his conviction for sexual assault, the imposable penalty for sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 is reclusion temporal medium or 14 years, eight months, and one day, as minimum, to 17 years and 4 months, as maximum.[138] Pursuant to Article XII, Section 31(c) of Republic Act No. 7610, the penalty of reclusion temporal medium shall be imposed against accused-¬¨‚â†appellant in its maximum period or 16 years, five months, and one day, as minimum, to 17 years and four months, as maximum considering that AAA270317 and BBB270317 are his daughters. Considering that the penalty to be imposed on accused-appellant is already the maximum set by law, the generic aggravating circumstance of cruelty present in one of the two counts of sexual assault committed by accused-appellant against AAA270317 can no longer be used to further increase the imposable penalty. A fine of PHP 15,000.00 is also meted out against accused-appellant pursuant to Article XII, Section 31(f) of Republic Act No. 7610.[139] More, he is civilly liable to pay: (1) PHP 50,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) PHP 50,000.00 as exemplary damages,[140] to AAA270317 and BBB270317 for each count of sexual assault that he perpetrated against them.Regarding, accused-appellant's conviction for qualified rape of a minor, Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code provides that it is punishable with the death penalty. However, in accordance with Republic Act No. 9346,[141] the penalty of reclusion perpetua without the possibility of parole is instead imposed against accused-appellant. Further, his civil liability for this crime is increased to: (1) PHP 150,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) PHP 150,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) PHP 150,000.00 as exemplary damages, in accordance with this Court's ruling in People v. Buclao.[142]Finally, the civil awards shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this judgment until full payment.[143]FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DENIED. The September 27, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 14955 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant XXX270317 is found GUILTY as follows:(1)in Criminal Case No. 19564, acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 and is SENTENCED to suffer the indeterminate penalty of 16 years, five months, and one day, as minimum, to 17 years and four months of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and to pay a fine amounting to PHP 15,000.00.

TRINIDAD, RESPONDENT.",11/13/24,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69777,THIRD DIVISION,DIMAAMPAO,"Hence, without full payment of the purchase price or an agreement conveying such right, a buyer's possession of a property that is the subject of a contract to sell would rest solely on the seller's tolerance. The case of Keppel Bank Philippines, Inc. v. Adao,[36] underscored this ruling and declared thus:Nonetheless, in this case, the contract to sell does not by itself give respondent the right to possess the property. Unlike in a contract of sale, here in a contract to sell, there is yet no actual sale nor any transfer of title, until and unless, full payment is made. The payment of the purchase price is a positive suspensive condition, the failure of which is not a breach, casual or serious, but a situation that prevents the obligation of the vendor to convey title from acquiring an obligatory force. Respondent must have fully paid the price to acquire title over the property and the right to retain possession thereof. In cases of non-payment, the unpaid seller can avail of the remedy of ejectment since he retains ownership of the property.Considering that respondent failed to discharge the burden of proving payment, he cannot claim ownership of the property and his possession thereof was by mere tolerance. His continued possession became unlawful upon the owner's demand to vacate the property. We stress, however, that this adjudication, is only a provisional determination of ownership for the purpose of settling the issue of possession, and does not bar or prejudice an action between the same parties involving title to the property.[37] (Emphasis supplied) In Union Bank of the Phils. v. Maunlad Homes, Inc.,[38] the Court similarly stated that the buyer's right to possess the property is extinguished when the contract to sell fails to materialize.[39] The failure of the buyer to make installment payments rendered the contract ineffective and without force and effect, consequently depriving them of the right to continue possession of the subject realty.[40]Guided by the foregoing considerations, the parties' agreement to enter into a contract to sell, by itself, did not alter the nature of Pagarao and Caballa's possession of the subject property ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ one that was initially unlawful but subsequently tolerated. That being said, the tolerance later extended by Trinidad cannot in effect afford her the remedy of an unlawful detainer. The appropriate course of action is still, distinctly, one for forcible entry.Absent the jurisdictional element of prior lawful possession, the Court resolves to reverse the assailed issuances of the CA and to dismiss the complaint for unlawful detainer for lack of cause of action. However, this is not to say that Trinidad is left without recourse, as she may still institute other actions to protect her rights over her property.FOR THESE REASONS, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The May 24, 2022 Decision and the January 11, 2023 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 168082 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Such a change is proscribed by the Constitution which requires inter alia the search warrant to particularly describe the place to be searched as well as the persons or things to be seized. It would concede to police officers the power of choosing the place to be searched, even if it not be that delineated in the warrant. It would open wide the door to abuse of the search process, and grant to officers executing a search warrant that discretion which the Constitution has precisely removed from them. The particularization of the description of the place to be searched may properly be done only by the Judge, and only in the warrant itself; it cannot be left to the discretion of the police officers conducting the search.[51]The party asserting that they had searched the correct house owned or possessed by petitioner as stated in the search warrant has the burden of proving that they had, indeed, searched the house owned or possessed by petitioner described in the search warrant. Here, that burden of proof was not discharged.Since both the contents of the search warrant and its execution are defective, all items seized during the search are inadmissible in evidence in this proceeding.[52] Without the seized firearms to prove the charge against petitioner, his guilt in this case was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Review is GRANTED.

XXX,[1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.",1/22/25,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69809,FIRST DIVISION,HERNANDO,"Hence, this appeal.[29]IssueThe issue is whether the CA erred in convicting accused-appellant for Qualified Trafficking in Persons.In a bid to evade criminal liability, accused-appellant argues that she lacked any malicious intent to exploit AAA and BBB when she invited them to work at the massage parlor. Instead, she claims her actions were merely motivated by a misguided desire to help them secure employment. She asserts that they were not coerced into their employment; rather, both of them voluntarily chose to work there following their training with her. Furthermore, accused-appellant contends that AAA and BBB were never forced or pressured to engage in sexual acts with male clients during their time at the massage parlor. She also denies instructing them to provide ""extra services"" or to engage in sexual intercourse with customers.[30]Our RulingThe appeal is unmeritorious. The CA did not err in convicting accused-¬¨‚â†appellant for the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons.Section 3 (a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, defines the term trafficking in persons. It states:SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ As used in this Act:(a) Trafficking in Persons ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.In People v. Becaylas,[31] We held that Trafficking in Persons requires the following elements:(1) The act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders""; (2) The means used which includes ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another""; and (3) The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[32]There are various ways through which the crime of human trafficking in persons can be perpetrated. These include the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transporting, transferring, maintaining, harboring, or receiving ""a person by any means . . . for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, [or] sexual exploitation[.]""[33]However, paragraph 2, section 3 (a)[34] of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 expressly provides an important distinction when it comes to minors. Specifically, the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered trafficking in persons, even if it does not involve any of the means stated under the law.[35] This distinction is crucial because, in the case of minors, even without the use of coercive, abusive, or deceptive means, a minor's consent is not considered to be given out of his or her own free will.[36] Furthermore, trafficking in persons may also be committed by taking advantage of a minor's vulnerability.[37]Given the particular vulnerability of children, the law considers trafficking to be qualified when the trafficked person is a child, thereby imposing more severe penalties on perpetrators.[38]Applying the foregoing law and jurisprudence, the prosecution satisfactorily established the presence of all the elements of the offense. As found by the RTC and the CA, the following are undisputed:First, it was accused-appellant who recruited AAA and BBB and offered them work as massage therapists, promising substantial earnings when they provided ""extra services"" or engaged in sexual intercourse with customers. Upon accepting accused-appellant's offer, she transported AAA and BBB from xxxxxxxxxxx to xxxxxxxxxxx to work in the massage parlor.Second, accused-appellant took advantage of their vulnerability as minor children who are in need of money. It is immaterial that AAA and BBB voluntarily agreed to go with accused-appellant in the first place. After all, it is axiomatic that a minor victim's knowledge or consent is not a defense under Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364. As discussed above, their consent is rendered meaningless due to the coercive, abusive, or deceptive means employed by perpetrators of human trafficking. Even without the use of such means, a minor's consent is not given out of their own free will.Third, accused-appellant demonstrated to AAA and BBB how to have sexual intercourse with potential customers of the massage parlor, and told them that aside from their income from doing massages, they would receive additional earnings for the ""extra services"" they would render to the customers. Thus, it is clear that accused-appellant's purpose in recruiting AAA and BBB were to exploit them by offering their sexual services to customers in exchange for money. In other words, she recruited AAA and BBB for the purpose of prostitution. The accused-appellant's contention that she lacked any malicious intent to exploit AAA and BBB since her actions were merely motivated by a misguided desire to help them secure employment is belied by the fact that she informed them of the massage parlor's ""extra services"" and demonstrated to them how to have sexual intercourse.Lastly, it is undisputed that AAA and BBB were minors at the time they were recruited by accused-appellant. Thus, this Court finds that the CA committed no reversible error when it found accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Trafficking in Persons.Contrary to the conclusion of the RTC, accused-appellant should be convicted of the consummated crime of trafficking in persons, not just attempted trafficking. This is because Republic Act No. 9208 does not require the victims to be actually subjected to prostitution or sexual exploitation before the accused can be held liable. What is essential under the law is that the victims are recruited and transported for the purpose of sexual exploitation, regardless of whether they were ultimately subjected to those activities. The law was passed precisely to curtail human trafficking, and this purpose would be undermined if a conviction for trafficking requires the victims to be actually subjected to the intended sexual exploitation.[39] In this case, AAA and BBB do not need to engage in or be subjected to sexual intercourse with the clients of the massage parlor for the crime of trafficking to be consummated.Similarly, accused-appellant's liability remains the same under the amendatory law, Republic Act No. 10364. To be clear, recruitment and transportation of persons remain predicate acts under both versions of the law. Thus, mere recruitment and transportation of persons through any of the means and for any of the purposes enumerated under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 10364 would be sufficient to consummate the crime and remove it from the ambit of attempted trafficking in persons under Section 4-A[40] of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364.[41]Simply stated, there is no requirement for actual sexual intercourse with AAA and BBB to establish a finding of trafficking. The crime is considered consummated even if no sexual intercourse has taken place. This is because the essence of the crime of trafficking lies in the act of recruiting or using, with or without consent, another person for the purpose of sexual exploitation.[42] In this case, accused-appellant consummated the crime the moment she recruited AAA and BBB for the intended purpose of sexual exploitation, regardless of whether the exploitation was ultimately carried out.Moreover, accused-appellant's mere denial of recruiting AAA and BBB for prostitution, or instructing them to provide ""extra services"" or engage in sexual intercourse with customers, cannot stand against the clear, consistent, and credible testimonies of AAA and BBB. It is a well-established principle that denial is an inherently weak defense; it constitutes self-serving negative evidence that cannot carry more evidentiary weight than the positive declarations made by credible witnesses.[43] Thus, accused-appellant's denial, unsupported by strong corroborating evidence, is insufficient to overcome the positive identification and detailed account provided by AAA and BBB regarding the accused-appellant's identity and involvement in the crime. The strength of their testimonies, when found to be credible by the lower courts, typically outweighs accused-appellant's unsupported denials.At this point, this Court notes that while the RTC and the CA arrived at different conclusions regarding the accused-appellant's conviction ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ the RTC finding attempted trafficking and the CA ruling for qualified trafficking ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ this discrepancy stems not from a misapprehension of facts, but rather from an erroneous application of the law by the RTC. Notably, however, both the lower courts are unanimous in their findings that accused-appellant: (1) recruited AAA and BBB to work as massage therapists, promising them an opportunity to earn money; and (2) instructed them to provide ""extra service"" ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a euphemism for sexual intercourse with customers ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ for additional income. This consistency in factual findings is significant since it is a well-established principle that the factual determinations and conclusions of trial courts are accorded great weight and respect, and are generally considered final and binding when upheld on appeal,[44] as in this case.Given the foregoing disquisition, it is beyond cavil that the prosecution incontrovertibly established the act, means, and purpose of the offense charged against accused-appellant. Considering that AAA and BBB are deemed children by law, accused-appellant is guilty of Qualified Trafficking in Persons.In sum, the Court sustains the conviction of accused-appellant for Qualified Trafficking in Persons.Penalty and DamagesThe CA correctly imposed the penalty under Section 10 (e)[45] of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 against the accused¬¨‚â† appellant for qualified trafficking in persons. The law prescribes life imprisonment and a fine of not less than PHP 2,000,000.00 but not more than PHP 5,000,000.00, against any person found guilty of qualified trafficking in persons.Further, in line with prevailing jurisprudence, the CA correctly affirmed the award of moral damages of PHP 500,000.00 and exemplary damages of PHPl00,000.00. Likewise, the CA correctly imposed on the total monetary awards 6% interest per annum pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence.[46]FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DISMISSED. The September 26, 2023 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 46577 is AFFIRMED.Accused-appellant XXX is found guilty of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4 (a), in relation to Section 6 (a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 and is sentenced to life imprisonment and to PAY a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00. She is further ordered to PAY AAA and BBB each PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.These monetary awards shall earn 6% interest per annum from finality of this Resolution until fully paid.SO ORDERED.

These issues are interdependent on each other since the property regime between the parties depends entirely on the status of their marriage, thus without these two issues, there can be no complete resolution of the case.With this, We now resolve the status of the marriage between petitioner and respondent. To reiterate, petitioner argued before the RTC that his marriage to Jimenez is valid and thus, his subsequent marriage to respondent is bigamous. We do not agree.A marriage is considered bigamous if it was contracted while a party's marriage has not yet been legally dissolved.[25] Bigamous or polygamous marriages are void from the beginning.[26]Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code defines bigamy:Article 349. Bigamy. ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ The penalty of [prision mayor] shall be imposed upon any person who shall contract a second or subsequent marriage before the former marriage has been legally dissolved, or before the absent spouse has been declared presumptively dead by means of a judgment rendered in the proper proceedings.Thus, the elements of bigamy are as follows: (1) the offender has been legally married; (2) the marriage has not been legally dissolved or, in case their spouse is absent, the absent spouse could not yet be presumed dead according to the Civil Code; (3) that they contract a second or subsequent marriage; and (4) that the second or subsequent marriage has all the essential requisites for validity.[27]From the foregoing, to claim bigamy, petitioner must not only show compliance with the requisites of marriage[28] but also must show that his prior marriage with Jimenez is valid and subsisting at the time of his second marriage with respondent Pring. To recall, petitioner married Jimenez in 1981 while his marriage with respondent Pring occurred in 1987. However, records are bereft of proof of the status of petitioner's first marriage at the time he married respondent Pring.Here, petitioner only presented the photocopy of the front page of the marriage certificate to prove the validity of his marriage with Jimenez. While the marriage certificate is the primary proof of marriage, the fact that the same marriage subsists during the time of the celebration of the second marriage was not reflected in the marriage certificate. Further, petitioner's narration that Jimenez is now living in the United States of America is self-serving and offers nothing of evidentiary value.[29] Thus, petitioner failed to prove that his second marriage with respondent Pring is bigamous.In Adong v. Cheong Seng Gee,[30] this Court explains that the law favors the validity of marriage, because the State is interested in the preservation of the family and the sanctity of the family is a matter of constitutional concern:The basis of human society throughout the civilized world is that of marriage. Marriage in this jurisdiction is not only a civil contract, but it is a new relation, an institution in the maintenance of which the public is deeply interested. Consequently, every intendment of the law leans toward legalizing matrimony. Persons dwelling together in apparent matrimony are presumed, in the absence of any counter-presumption or evidence special to the case, to be in fact married. The reason is that such is the common order of society, and if the parties were not what they thus hold themselves out as being, they would be living in the constant violation of decency and of law. A presumption established by our Code of Civil Procedure is ""that a man and woman deporting themselves as husband and wife have entered into a lawful contract of marriage."" Semper praesumitur pro matrimonio‚Äö√Ñ√ÆAlways presume marriage.[31] (Citations omitted)The presumption is always in favor of the validity of marriage. Any doubt should be resolved to sustain such validity. Indeed, this Court is mindful of this principle as well as of the Constitutional policy which protects and strengthens the family as the basic autonomous social institution and marriage as the foundation of the family.[32] In this case, having failed to establish petitioner's claim of bigamy, then the presumption on validity of his marriage with respondent Pring prevails.Considering that the marriage of petitioner and respondent Pring occurred prior to the effectivity of the Family Code, then the Civil Code governs their property relations.Article 160 of the Civil Code provides:ART. 160. All property of the marriage is presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership, unless it be proved that it pertains exclusively to the husband or to the wife.In the case at bar, the subject properties were all bought during the subsistence of marriage of petitioner and respondent. Notably, no evidence were presented as to their actual contribution in the acquisition of the subject properties. Thus, the subject properties are part of their conjugal partnership.FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The May 16, 2022 Decision and December 13, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 05413-MIN are AFFIRMED. The marriage of petitioner Leoncio L. Melocoton and respondent Jennifer B. Pring is valid. The subject properties acquired by petitioner and respondent during their marriage covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 114328, 114329, 171550, 171551, 171552, 171553, and 171554 are conjugal.SO ORDERED.

Only when the COA clearly acted without or in excess of jurisdiction amounting to grave abuse of discretion, will the Court step in.[58] In these consolidated cases, the Court finds that both petitioners and PSALM have failed to establish that the assailed COA Decision was tainted with grave abuse of discretion.

G.R. No. 259051 (Formerly UDK No. 17094),"EDWARD C. CIACHO, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES ADOLFO T. DE GUIA* AND FE ALMA V. DE GUIA [DECEASED]; AND BAYANI S. CERILLA [DECEASED], SUBSTITUTED BY HIS HEIRS, MARY BERNADETTE G. CERILLA AND BYATRES MARI CERILLA-BOHOL, RESPONDENTS.",2/26/25,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69907,THIRD DIVISION,SINGH,"Hence, as correctly ruled by the RTC and the CA, there was no valid transfer of ownership of the subject properties to Ciacho.[61] Neither did the issuance of titles for the subject properties registered under the name of Ciacho cure the lack of title or authority of Cerilla to transfer the ownership of the subject properties. As correctly found by the CA, settled is the rule that the issuance of a certificate of title is not a grant of ownership over the property, but merely an evidence of such ownership or right thereon.[62] Further, Ciacho cannot be considered as an innocent purchaser for value. Generally, to be considered an innocent purchaser for value, the buyer does not have any notice of defect or irregularity as to the right or interest of the seller, and the buyer is without notice that a third party has a claim to the subject property.[63] Thus, if there is anything on the certificate of title that leads to suspicion or raises any cloud on the title, right or ownership of the subject property, the buyer cannot be deemed as an innocent purchaser for value.[64] Here, the Court gives credence to the factual findings of the RTC and CA: True, de Guia [Adolfo] was called to shed light on the existence of his Adverse Claim. De Guia [Adolfo] and Cerilla assured Ciacho that their problem was already settled. In fact, the adverse claim was cancelled and de Guia [Adolfo] was made to sign the Deed of Mortgage to show his conformity thereto. While it may be correct to say, that with the cancellation of the Adverse Claim and the conformity of Adolfo T. De Guia to the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage might have assured Ciacho to proceed with the grant of the loan without any further fear of impediment of title, yet the fact remains that Ciacho cannot feign ignorance of the nature of the adverse claim which is indeed anchored on a Deed of Absolute Sale expected by Cerilla in favor of De Guia [Adolfo]. Equally, Ciacho must have known that Cerilla's title came from the De Guias and should have been extra¬¨‚â† inquisitive why the re-sale. If these were not known to Ciacho, or that he failed to know or did not bother to know these glaring facts despite the appearance of De Guia [Adolfo] before him, this Court believes that Ciacho had not exercised the due diligence required to qualify him as a mortgagee in good faith. Having known the sale and re-sale between De Guia [Adolfo] and Cerilla, Ciacho should have exercised extra prudence in extending the loan with mortgage. The matter of sale and re-sale is a clear indicator of an apparent flaw of Cerilla's titles which should have buoyed up more of Ciacho's caution in dealing with the said certificates of title. Yet, Ciacho turned his back away from his evident fact of sale and re-sale, and instead proceeded with the loan. In fact, he admitted from his own testimony that his concern was not so much on the mortgaged properties but more with the loan and the agreed interest.[65] As for the damages prayed for by Cerilla, which the RTC and CA did not award in his favor, the Court can no longer pass upon the same as issues on the amount of damages are factual questions that the Court may not resolve in a Rule 45 Petition. Thus, absent any clear showing that the trial court overlooked the facts and circumstances of this case, the Court will not disturb or overturn its findings.[66] Considering the foregoing, the Court finds no reason to disturb the factual findings and rulings of the RTC and the CA. Undoubtedly, the sale of the subject properties to Ciacho is void as Adolfo remained the true owner thereof. FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by Edward C. Ciacho is DENIED for lack of merit. The Court of Appeals Decision, dated December 19, 2019, and the Resolution, dated May 27, 2021, in CA-G.R. CEB CV. No. 05536, are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.

G.R. No. 275139,"PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. LEOPOLDO SINGCOL, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.",5/7/25,https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/69895,FIRST DIVISION,HERNANDO,"Accordingly, the accused must establish the concurrence of three elements of unlawful aggression, namely: (a) there must be a physical or material attack or assault; (b) the attack or assault must be actual, or, at least, imminent; and (c) the attack or assault must be unlawful.Unlawful aggression is of two kinds: (a) actual or material unlawful aggression; and (b) imminent unlawful aggression. Actual or material unlawful aggression means an attack with physical force or with a weapon, an offensive act that positively determines the intent of the aggressor to cause the injury. Imminent unlawful aggression means an attack that is impending or at the point of happening; it must not consist in a mere threatening attitude, nor must it be merely imaginary, but must be offensive and positively strong (like aiming a revolver at another with intent to shoot or opening a knife and making a motion as if to attack). Imminent unlawful aggression must not be a mere threatening attitude of the victim, such as pressing his[/her] right hand to his[/her] hip where a revolver was holstered, accompanied by an angry countenance, or like aiming to throw a pot.[33] (Emphasis supplied) The RTC based its conclusion of unlawful aggression on its finding that ""while [accused-appellant] was taking his breakfast after plowing his cornfield in the morning, his father Andres arrived, they had a heated argument and Andres attempted to hack him as what always happened prior to that incident whenever Andres got angry.""[34]Accused-appellant advanced his version of Andres's alleged unlawful aggression in this manner: Q: What was the reason why your father hacked you at that time? A: I do not know of his reason for hacking me. Q: How many times, if you remember, did your father attempt to hack you, Mr. Witness? A: Many times. Q: And every time he attempts to hack you, what did you do? A: I always evade his thrust. Q: For how long have you been evading his thrust? A: Not long. Q: What happened after you continued evading his thrust? A: I was able to get hold of the bolo because he stumbled to the ground when his one foot tripped off the stone. Q: After you got hold of the bolo, what happened next, Mr. Witness? A: I stabbed him because he continuously hurt me.[35] There is no unlawful aggression from this narration.Indeed, Andres attacked accused-appellant with a bolo first. However, We deviate from the findings of the trial court as to who is the actual unlawful aggressor. At the time when accused-appellant stabbed Andres, the latter already lost full control of the bladed weapon, as accused-appellant has gotten hold of it and Andres has stumbled to the ground. At that point, there was no more unlawful aggression to speak of, whether actual or imminent, and accused-appellant had no more need to defend himself. Still, accused-appellant proceeded to stab Andres, which resulted to the latter's death. From then on, accused-appellant can only be seen as the aggressor.The CA made a similar note, which the Court echoes:The [CA] finds inescapable the conclusion that, by [Leopoldo]'s testimony, when his father had stumbled to the ground, the alleged aggression has stopped.[36] Accused-appellant further betrayed himself on cross examination: Q: You said, Mr. Witness, that your father fell off balance and dropped to the ground? A: Yes, Ma'am. .... Q: And you stabbed him? A: I stabbed him because he continued hurting, Ma'am. Q: But at that time, Mr. Witness, he was already lying on the ground when you picked up the bolo? A: No, not yet. He was still holding the bolo. Q: When he fell off [sic] the ground, Mr. Witness, you stabbed him? A: No, not yet. Q: At what point in time, Mr. Witness, did you take the bolo? A: He continued hacking and when I held his arms, I twisted them and so I was able to get hold of the bolo. Q: At what time after you got the bolo, Mr. Witness, he fell off the ground? A: He fell to the ground after I stabbed him. Q: After he fell to the ground, you stabbed him? A: No, not yet. He was still holding the bolo. Q: So, he was on the ground, Mr. Witness, when you were grappling with the bolo? A: Yes. He was about to fall down to the ground, I was able to get hold of the bolo. Q: And eventhough [sic] he was already on the act of tripping off on the ground, you stabbed him? A: Yes.[37] Accused-appellant presented a story on Andres's unlawful aggression, which the trial court believed completely. This ruling by the RTC favoring the fact of Andres's unlawful aggression against accused-appellant, however, seems to be impelled by pity rather than evidence. From his testimony, accused-appellant failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Andres made an overwhelming first attack that endangered accused-appellant's life and which continued until accused-appellant had to inflict a fatal blow upon Andres as a necessary means of self-preservation.With this, accused-appellant's defense-of-self theory fails. Self-defense, whether complete or incomplete, is unavailing as an exempting circumstance if there was no unlawful aggression by the victim in the first place.Further discussions on the second and third elements of self-defense, which are the reasonable necessity of the accused's defense and lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the accused, are rendered irrelevant and ineffectual by the absence of the first element, that is, the victim's unlawful aggression.The Court, however, appreciates a different mitigating circumstance in favor of Leopoldo.Article 13 of the Revised Penal Code lists the following as mitigating circumstances:1. Those mentioned in the preceding chapter, when all the requisites necessary to justify or to exempt from criminal liability in the respective cases are not attendant.2. That the offender is under eighteen years of age or over seventy years. In the case of the minor, he shall be proceeded against in accordance with the provisions of Article 80.3. That the offender had no intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed.4. That sufficient provocation or threat on the part of the offended party immediately preceded the act.5. That the act was committed in the immediate vindication of a grave offense to the one committing the felony (delito), his spouse, ascendants, descendants, legitimate, natural, or adopted brothers or sisters, or relatives by affinity within the same degrees.6. That of having acted upon an impulse so powerful as naturally to have produced passion or obfuscation. 7. That the offender had voluntarily surrendered himself[/herself] to a person in authority or his[/her] agents, or that he[/she] had voluntarily confessed his[/her] guilt before the court prior to the presentation of the evidence for the prosecution;8. That the offender is deaf and dumb, blind or otherwise suffering some physical defect which thus restricts his[/her] means of action, defense, or communications with his[/her] fellow beings.9. Such illness of the offender as would diminish the exercise of the will¬¨‚â†power of the offender without however depriving him[/her] of the consciousness of his[/her] acts.10. And, finally, any other circumstances of a similar nature and analogous to those above mentioned. (Emphasis supplied) In this case, the Court observes a mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation.For passional obfuscation to mitigate one's criminal liability, the following must concur: (1) That there be an act both unlawful and sufficient to produce such condition of mind; and (2) That the said act which produces the obfuscation was not far removed from the commission of the crime by a considerable length of time, during which the perpetrator might recover his [/her] normal equanimity.[38] Both elements are in this case's parricide.It is extractable from all of the witnesses' testimonies that accused-appellant killed Andres when the latter deliberately went to the former's house to confront the former. The Court also assents to the trial court's conclusions that Andres tried to hack accused-appellant with a bolo first.What catches the Court's attention but escapes its understanding, and which were not at all considered by the courts a quo, are the events that transpired immediately after accused-appellant stabbed Andres.Upon seeing Andres bloodied and motionless, accused-appellant took Andres in his arms, carried him, and asked for his father's forgiveness. Accused-appellant thereafter obtained a pair of scissors, which he used to slice his own throat and abdomen.Accused-appellant testified in this manner: Q: After you stabbed him, Mr. Witness, what did you do, if any? A: I carried him and asked for his forgiveness. Q: How did you say sorry to your father, Mr. Witness? A: I carried him and I said, ""Tay, I am sorry. I cannot do it if not because of you."" . . . . Q: After you said sorry to your father, Mr. Witness, what did your father tell you, if any? A: He wasn't able to say anything. . . . . Q: You said that your father was no longer able to answer after you asked forgiveness from him, you said that you carried him and asked forgiveness, what happened next after that, Mr. Witness? A: I stabbed myself. Q: Will you please tell to this Honorable Court how did you attempt to kill yourself at that time? A: I slashed my throat. (Witness is pointing to his neck.) Q: After that, Mr. Witness, what did you do next? A: I also stabbed myself. (Witness is showing the scar on his stomach.) Q: Earlier you pointed to your neck, Mr. Witness, what's with your neck? A: My scar. . . . . Q: What did you use in slashing your throat, Mr. Witness? A: Scissors. . . . . Q: Where did you get the scissors, Mr. Witness? A: On the table. Q: Why is there a pair of scissors on the table? A: Because my wife is a dressmaker.[39] Accused-appellant's daughter, Rosalie, confirmed this act of self-harm, as she expressed in open court that she tried to stop her father from hurting himself: Q: When you saw your grandfather blooded [sic], what did you do? A: I asked helped [sic] but during that time my father went upstairs so, I followed him. Q: You mentioned that you followed your father and what did you witness when you followed him? A: I saw him getting the scissor[s] wherein my mother used that for sewing. Q: What did he do with that scissor[s] Ms. Witness? A: He got the scissor[s] and used that in slicing his throat. ATTY. [SENIT]: May we put that on record, Your Honor, that the witness is crying, Your Honor. COURT: Put that on record that the witness is crying while testifying. ATTY. [SENIT]: Q: When you saw your father [slash] his neck what did you do? A: I first struggle[d] to [get] the scissor[s] and it took me quite a time then, after I got hold [of] the scissor[s] I [threw] that on the [grass]. Q: After you threw the scissor[s] [on] the [grass] what did you do next? A: I was looking for a medicine for him to put some medication. Q: Were you able to get the medicine Ms. Witness? A: I [was] not, ma'am. Q: After you were unable to find a medicine what did you do next? A: I went back to where my father was but I noticed that he was no longer there.[40] Passion or obfuscation is a state of mind present when a crime is committed as a result of an uncontrollable burst of passion provoked by prior unjust or improper acts or by a legitimate stimulus so powerful as to overcome reason.[41] By ""legitimate stimulus,"" the causes that mitigate the criminal responsibility for the loss of self-control must originate from legitimate feelings, not those which arise from vicious, unworthy, and immoral passions.[42] They must arise from lawful sentiments and not from a spirit of lawlessness or revenge or from anger and resentment.[43]By no means can the Court dismiss accused-appellant's feelings as illegitimate. Accused-appellant intimated before the trial court that he was an abused child. He testified that whenever Andres is enraged, he would turn his anger towards accused-appellant using a bolo; that he did all the farming labor growing up; that he felt that he was not Andres's son because of how he looked and how he was treated very differently from his siblings, and how Andres would direct his anger at accused-appellant whenever Andres quarreled with accused-appellant's mother, Flaviana; that Andres continued to routinely maltreat and hack at accused-appellant with a bolo in adulthood, even after the latter got married.[44]Any allegation of psychological trauma is preferably confirmed by expert testimony. Still, the mental status of a person is readily discernible from one's outward and actual behavior. While the story of Andres's abusive parenting rested entirely on the sole account of accused-appellant, the latter's actions of slicing his own neck and stomach spoke louder than his words and corroborated his version of maltreatment. From the above narrations by accused-appellant, coupled with his extreme and illogical acts of self-harm immediately after he killed Andres as corroborated by Rosalie, impel Us to view the parricide as a fit of uncontrolled emotions. The Court deems the parricide in this case as a product of a sudden surge of the accused's bottled-up feelings caused by paternal neglect since childhood, detonated by the usual hurtful acts towards him by his father, or even just the mere presence of the latter, being the accused's chronic abuser. Accused-appellant's violent stance against Andres was to be expected and symptomatic of passion and obfuscation.Parricide is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death.[45] Where there is one mitigating circumstance and no aggravating circumstance in the commission of parricide, the penalty to be imposed is reclusion perpetua,[46] following Article 63[47] of the Revised Penal Code.The CA's awards of civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and temperate damages to Andres's heirs are affirmed as it conformed to prevailing jurisprudence.[48] Accused-appellant is guilty of murder for the killing of Egmedia As regards Egmedia's death, We agree with the CA's ruling convicting accused-appellant of murder.To successfully prosecute an accused for murder, the following elements must be proven: (1) A person was killed; (2) The accused killed him or her; (3) The killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code; and (4) The killing is not parricide or infanticide. Pertinent to this case, Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code provides:Article 248. Murder. ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death, if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:1. With treachery. . .. . . .5. With evident premeditation.Treachery is the use of means, methods, or forms in the execution of the crime against persons that tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the victim might make.[49]The essence of treachery is an attack that is deliberate and without warning, swift and unexpected, affording the hapless, unarmed, and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape.[50]Treachery requires two conditions: first, the employment of means of execution that gives the victim no opportunity to defend or retaliate; and second, the means of execution was deliberately or consciously adopted by the accused.[51]Both of the above elements of treachery obtain in this case. Indeed, Egmedia was informed of the impending danger to her life that was accused-appellant. This is precisely why she immediately fled the bugak with her children: to avoid a face-to-face encounter with accused-appellant when they learned from Flaviana that ""there was trouble in the house;""[52] that accused-appellant ""was getting mad.""[53]Aware of the danger, however, is not synonymous to being prepared to defend oneself against such danger. The Court quotes with approval the findings of the appellate court on this point:In this case, the testimony of [Rubelin], the prosecution witness[,] had proven treachery on the part of accused-appellant; thus: [. . . .] Q: So, upon the arrival of your grandmother[,] [Flaviana,] telling you to immediately leave the spring what did you, your brother[,] [Jonathan,] and your mother[,] [Egmedia,] do? A: We immediately left the spring and we passed at the small terrain because according to our Lola we will [use] this terrain so that we will not come across [accused-appellant]. Q: Now, can you [describe] the terrain you used? A: It's [sloping]. Q: While going home [you are] going up or going down? A: We are on that sloping terrain going uphill. Q: No, while walking in that terrain Madam Witness, what transpired if any? A: We were able to meet [accused-appellant]. [....] Q: What if any, did [accused-appellant] do? A: He [met] and directly stabbed my mother. Q: And what happened when you said he [met] your mother and directly stabbed her? A: Then, my brother was also stabbed and after stabbing my brother my mother [lost her hold on] my brother and he again [stabbed] my mother. Q: By the way, what is the position of your mother at that time when [you were] going up the slope going home? A: She was carrying . . . my younger brother. Q: You said that during the first blow who was hit by the stab? A: My younger brother, ma'am. Q: And what happened when your younger brother was hit by the first blow delivered by [accused-appellant]? A: He was hit on his stomach and the intestine went out from his stomach. Q: What was the position of your mother and your brother at the time when the first blow was delivered by [accused-appellant]? A: My mother was carrying my brother and after the stabbing of my younger brother my mother fell to the ground because she was [outbalanced] at the time of the stabbing [by accused-appellant]. Q: And what happened to your [mother]? A: My mother [lost her hold on] my brother because she got outbalanced so, after that [accused-appellant] again [stabbed] my mother. Q: Could you remember what part of the body of your mother was stabbed by your uncle? A: At her chest, ma'am. The Court notes that the victim was carrying her [two-year-old] son on a sloping terrain when accused-appellant, without warning and through an almost stealthy manner, stabbed her. Apparently, accused-appellant had adopted means, a method or form of attack, to ensure its commission and without giving the victim the opportunity to defend herself.A frontal attack may be regarded as treacherous when it was so sudden on an unsuspecting, or an unarmed victim, who had no chance to repel the attack or avoid it.The trial court is incorrect when it ruled that there was no treachery on the ground that the victim, [Egmedia], was already warned that accused-appellant was mad at her. In People v. Napalit, the High Court ruled that even when the victim was forewarned of the danger to his person, treachery may still be appreciated since what is decisive is that the execution of the attack made it impossible for the victim to defend himself/herself or to retaliate.Moreover, the victim, [Egmedia], at that time, was unarmed, carrying her [two-year-old] child and walking on an uphill terrain. Thus, even if she was forewarned of the impending danger, it was unlikely that she could be able to defend herself from the attack of accused-appellant.[54] (Citations omitted) Thus, Egmedia's killing is attended by treachery, which qualifies the crime to murder.The Court also takes the occasion to rule out the second alleged aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation in the killing of Egmedia.To appreciate the circumstance of evident premeditation, it is necessary to establish the following: first, a previous decision to commit the crime; second, an overt act or acts manifestly indicating that the accused has clung to their determination; and third, a sufficient lapse of time between the decision to commit the crime and its actual execution to allow the accused to reflect upon the consequences of their act(s) and to allow their conscience to overcome the resolution of their will, had they desired to hearken to its warnings.[55]None of the above elements of evident premeditation is established. Per Annaliza, a witness for the prosecution, Andres had advised accused-appellant ""that whatever plan [accused-appellant] had [against Egmedia], [accused-appellant should] not do it,""[56] and that he is ""not to harm""[57] or ""not to pursue his plan [on Egmedia].""[58] These statements are too vague and unspecific to constitute evident premeditation. There is no clear or direct proof showing beyond a reasonable doubt that accused-appellant decided to kill Egmedia; that he meditated and reflected upon his decision to kill Egmedia; and that, despite such calm retrospect and the lapse of a sufficient amount of time within which he could have changed his mind, he still proceeded to kill Egmedia.Murder is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death.[59] Where there is no aggravating circumstance other than that which is established in the commission of murder, the penalty to be imposed is reclusion perpetua,[60] following Article 63[61] of the Revised Penal Code.The CA's awards of civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and temperate damages to Egmedia's heirs are affirmed as it conformed to prevailing jurisprudence.[62]FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DISMISSED. The March 15, 2024 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 02401-MIN is AFFIRMED.
